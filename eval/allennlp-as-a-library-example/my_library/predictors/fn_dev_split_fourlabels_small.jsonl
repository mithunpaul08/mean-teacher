In a story which was published early this morning , The National Report claimed that Banksy was arrested in London by a 24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force and revealed to be a 35-year-old man named Paul Horner .

{"claim": "Soon Marijuana May Lead to Ticket , Not Arrest , in New York", "evidence": "After campaigning on a promise to reform stop-and-frisk , Mayor Bill de Blasio is set to launch his most significant effort to address the issues raised by the policy . Law-enforcement officials tell the New York Times that soon the NYPD may issue tickets for low-level marijuana possession rather than making arrests . Under the de Blasio administration 's planned changes to the city 's marijuana policy , those caught with a small amount of weed would be issued a court summons , but avoid a trip to the police station . The shift could have a huge impact in black and Latino communities , as a recent study found those groups represented 86 percent of those arrested for marijuana possession in the city this year . The de Blasio administration is still working out the details , such as how much weed one could possess without triggering an arrest , and some are already unhappy with the proposed change . Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson , who announced this year that he would stop prosecuting small-scale marijuana possession cases , said that telling people to show up in a court room without arresting them may actually be worse for minorities . `` In order to give the public confidence in the fairness of the criminal justice system , these cases should be subject to prosecutorial review , '' Thompson explained . `` By allowing these cases to avoid early review , by issuing a summons , there is a serious concern that many summonses will be issued without the safeguards currently in place . These cases will move forward even when due process violations might have occurred . '' In other words , do n't expect the debate about how NYPD officers should proceed when they catch someone with a joint to be resolved anytime soon .", "label": "discuss"}

In that case , the nun had been raped abroad by a foreign priest and initially gave her daughter up for adoption . The case engendered strong protests from the adoptive family after it reached Italy 's highest court of appeals in February 2014 after the nun changed her mind and was granted custody , reversing a lower court decision .", "label": "unrelated"}

The group 's leader , Abubakar Shekau , said the girls had converted to Islam and been married off since being taken . Nigeria 's army announced a ceasefire with the militants on 17 October , saying the girls would soon be freed . But violence has continued since news of the alleged truce , including a fatal bomb blast on Friday . Boko Haram has been fighting an insurgency since 2009 , with some 2,000 civilians reportedly killed this year . 'We will not negotiate' In a video released on Friday , Abubakar Shekau said : `` We have not made ceasefire with anyone . We did not negotiate with anyone . It 's a lie . `` We will not negotiate . What is our business with negotiation ? Allah said we should not . '' Shekau also claimed that the militants were holding a German national , thought to be a teacher , who was kidnapped by gunmen in July . There was no indication of when or where the group 's latest video was shot . The BBC 's Tomi Oladipo in Lagos says the video will come as a huge embarrassment for the Nigerian government after it said it had secured a ceasefire with Boko Haram . The Islamist militants sparked global outrage in April by abducting 219 schoolgirls from the remote north-eastern town of Chibok , in Borno state . Their continued captivity has led to criticism of the Nigerian government 's efforts to secure their release . Hopes were raised earlier this month when Nigeria 's chief of defence staff , Alex Badeh , announced a truce with the group . `` They 've assured us they have the girls and they will release them , '' he said . `` I am cautiously optimistic . '' But the Boko Haram leader said the girls were `` in their marital homes '' after being married off by the group . Last week , Human Rights Watch said in a report that Boko Haram was holding more than 500 women and young girls captive and that forced marriage was common in the group 's camps .", "label": "unrelated"}

Defense officials told NBC News that U.S. military and military intelligence have no information to confirm ISIS ' claim , and the State Department said it could not confirm reports of the death `` in any way . '' `` We are obviously deeply concerned by these reports . We have not at this time seen any evidence that corroborates ISIL 's claim , '' said Bernadette Meehan , spokeswoman for the National Security Council said . Kayla Mueller , originally from Arizona , was taken hostage by ISIS in Syria on Aug. 4 , 2013 , while leaving a Spanish Doctors Without Borders hospital . Her family previously had requested Mueller 's name not be made public for fear it would endanger her life . According to a statement released by a representative of her family on Friday urging caution in reporting on Mueller 's situation , `` the common thread of Kayla 's life has been her quiet leadership and strong desire to serve others . '' `` Kayla has devoted her career to helping those in need in countries around the world , '' the statement added . In a report distributed on Twitter , ISIS stated that Mueller was buried in the rubble of a building hit by Jordanian aircraft . Jordanian warplanes have pounded ISIS targets in Syria since the militants released a video that appeared to show a captured Jordanian fighter pilot being burned alive in a cage . Jordan disputed the ISIS claim . `` ISIS is being illogical and they 're lying , '' Mohammad Al Moumani , a spokesman for the information ministry , told NBC News . `` How do they know it 's a Jordanian aircraft ? What was a woman doing in their training center or weapons storage facility ? Because those are what we 're targeting .

Mueller 's family previously had requested that her name not be made public , and little has been publicized about her ordeal . Her interest in activism started young : she was recognized as a National Young Leader while in high school at Tri City College Prep in Prescott , Arizona , and won several volunteering awards . As a teen , she volunteered for the Save Darfur Coalition , writing letters and placing calls to members of Congress , according to her local paper . Mueller also later wrote about Darfur while at Northern Arizona University , penning a piece in the school paper , The Lumberjack . After graduating from Northern Arizona University in 2009 , Mueller worked with humanitarian aid organizations in India , Israel and Palestine , according to the statement issued on behalf of her family . It said she returned home to Arizona in 2011 and spent a year working at an HIV/AIDS clinic and a women 's shelter before traveling to France to work as an au pair and study the French language . Sometime that year , Mueller uploaded a video to YouTube expressing solidarity with the Syrian people . While she initially studied French with the intention of working in Africa , according to the family representatives , Mueller instead went to the Turkish-Syrian border to work with Syrian refugees in December 2012 . Mueller spoke of her experiences in Syria at her local Kiwanis club in May 2013 , saying that she is often asked \u2014 once people learn she is American \u2014 `` where is the world '' by desperate refugees . `` All I can do is cry with them , because I do n't know , '' she said , according to an article on the event in her local paper . `` For as long as I live , I will not let this suffering be normal .

ISIS demanded a $ 6.6 million ransom for her freedom , and/or the release of Aafia Siddiqui , a Pakistani neuroscientist convicted of attempted murder by a New York federal court in 2010 .

Close to 300 teenage girls were kidnapped by armed gunmen as they were driven back to their school in coaches after an excursion . Some managed to escape , but an estimated 219 are still being held captive , reportedly in Nigeria \u2019 s neighbour , Cameroon , whose military was involved in the ceasefire talks . There was immediate scepticism , however . One Western diplomat in Lagos , Nigeria \u2019 s coastal commercial capital , pointed out that Goodluck Jonathan , the president , is in the middle of campaigning for the presidential elections due next year . \u201c He \u2019 s having a tough run with Boko Haram , and he needs a boost , \u201d the diplomat said . \u201c It \u2019 s the main thing that people are concerned about , security . If he can score a ceasefire , great . If he can bring the girls back , even better . \u201c But we \u2019 ve not yet heard from Boko Haram . Until then , we \u2019 re taking this with a little salt. \u201d Aid groups working to secure the release of the schoolgirls welcomed the news , but also remained cautious . \u201c This ceasefire is incredibly promising , but we aren \u2019 t there yet , \u201d said Hussaini Abdu , country director for ActionAid Nigeria . \u201c Until every girl is released negotiations must continue . \u201c We are excited about the possibility of restoring peace in the country , but these girls must remain a priority and we therefore urge the government to ensure that the safety of all of them is guaranteed as part of any truce. \u201d Britain is among several nations that has offered assistance to the Nigerian government and its military to help find the missing schoolgirls . Privately , Western security sector sources in the country report exasperation among those coming to help over the slow pace of the Nigerians \u2019 reactions to the kidnap crisis . The girls are understood to have been separated into several groups , making an armed rescue far more complicated and dangerous , leaving talks as the only likely route to their release . Boko Haram has in the past insisted that it would only release the teenagers if Nigeria freed several of the group \u2019 s senior commanders , who have been captured and are in jail . There were no immediate details of what Boko Haram will get out of the ceasefire deal . The group has been blamed for hundreds of killings in bomb or gun attacks , and it is increasingly choosing targets over an ever wider area of northern Nigeria . It began as a local militia targeting people who broke strict Islamic regulations such as drinking alcohol . But it recently linked with al-Qaeda \u2019 s franchise in West Africa , al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb , and appears to have taken on far more ambitious aims , including ridding northern Nigeria of Christians . Boko Haram \u2019 s leader , Abubakar Shekau , frequently justifies attacks on Christians as revenge for killings of Muslims in Nigeria \u2019 s volatile \u201c Middle Belt \u201d , where the largely Christian south and mostly Muslim north meet . The Telegraph revealed last month that the International Committee of the Red Cross had become involved in a secret prisoner swap deal that would ensure the schoolgirls ' return . Officials from the Geneva-based organisation sat in on talks between the Nigerian government and a senior Boko Haram leader that was being held in one of the country 's maximum security prisons . The Red Cross officials also visited a number of other jails , identifying a list of 16 senior commanders that Boko Haram wants freed in exchange for the 219 hostages kidnapped from the north-east town of Chibok . The ICRC 's role in the talks represented the first official confirmation that the Nigerian government was actively engaged in talks with Boko Haram . Publicly , Nigeria 's president , Goodluck Jonathan , has previously maintained that the government would never agree to any kind of negotiations .", "label": "discuss"}
{"claim": "James Foley , Missing American Photojournalist , Reportedly Executed By ISIS In Syria", "evidence": "On Friday , the Nigerian military reportedly agreed to a truce with the militant group Boko Haram . According to the announcement , more than 200 Nigerian schoolgirls who were abducted this year will be freed . According to CNN , the details of the release are expected to be negotiated next week . In August , the militant group Boko Haram declared an `` Islamic state '' in northeastern Nigeria , a territory largely occupied by the fighters . Boko Haram is believed to be hiding the girls somewhere in this area . This week marked six months since the mass kidnapping took place . Here 's what has happened since . On April 14 , 276 Nigerian girls were kidnapped by Boko Haram militants from a school in Chibok , northern Nigeria , according to official figures . The mass abduction occurred at night , and it took days before the full scale of the kidnapping became clear . Shortly after the abductions , a military spokesperson claimed that most of the girls had been rescued by Nigerian soldiers , but the remarks turned out to be wrong . Whether or not the Nigerian army is suited to finding the girls has been questioned : Its reputation in the rural north is bad , and it is often accused of lacking transparency and its soldiers of committing crimes . One recent video allegedly showed Nigerian soldiers slitting prisoners ' throats , according to Amnesty International . In the weeks following the mass kidnapping , criticism of the Nigerian government and the military had quickly grown as they failed to free the girls . In May , Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau released a video message claiming that the girls would `` remain slaves with us . '' Nearly 200 days have passed since the girls were abducted , and according to estimates , more than 200 schoolgirls are still being held by Boko Haram militants . Only a few dozen girls have managed to escape over the past months : The Times of London cited an example of four girls who were able to flee from their captors and walked for three weeks through the jungle . Most of the escapes , however , took place shortly after the abductions , as this graph shows . As time passed , hope faded for many parents , and reports of escapes became less frequent . `` The longer they 're there , the greater likelihood they become dispersed , and the more difficult they are to track down , '' Jennifer Cook , director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , told Time magazine this week , before the reports emerged that Boko Haram was considering freeing them . There are conflicting numbers of how many girls are still in captivity \u2014 some say 215 , some say 219 . The numbers used in our graph only refer to the mass kidnapping in April . Other abductions of women and girls have occurred since . Boko Haram is predominantly active in the northeast of Nigeria , where the girls were kidnapped , but its sphere of influence extends further into the west and south of the country . The militants have conducted an increasing number of attacks over the past few months and are now believed to be active in an area which could be up to 500,000 square kilometers , or 193,000 square miles . Its core area spreads over as much as 250,000 square kilometers , roughly the size of the United Kingdom . However , Boko Haram is not in full control of most of the areas in which it is active . Fatalities from non-criminal Nigerian violence \u2014 a term that includes attacks by terror groups and communal or political actors \u2014 have risen rapidly since 2010 , and Boko Haram attacks are the main driver behind this rise . The militant group has killed at least 5,100 Nigerians this year , according to estimates of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies . This graph shows how fatalities caused by Boko Haram went up from around zero to more than 5,000 annually within only six years . Although the threat posed by Boko Haram had grown steadily , it took until the April abductions for the conflict to make international headlines . The burst of reporting was accompanied by a huge rise in attention to Boko Haram on social media . Up until May 13 , about 3.3 million tweets were posted , using the hashtag # BringBackOurGirls . According to the BBC , most people who used the hashtag lived in Nigeria ( 27 percent ) and the United States ( 26 percent ) . Still , thousands of tweets are being posted each week in an effort to raise awareness about the fate of the Nigerian schoolgirls . The social media campaign found prominent supporters : As of Oct. 17 , more than 57,000 users had retweeted Michelle Obama 's message : `` Our prayers are with the missing Nigerian girls and their families . It 's time to # BringBackOurGirls . '' Our prayers are with the missing Nigerian girls and their families . It 's time to # BringBackOurGirls . -mo pic.twitter.com/glDKDotJRt \u2014 The First Lady ( @ FLOTUS ) May 7 , 2014 The Obama administration deployed 80 U.S. military personnel to Chad in May . In a letter , the White House said : `` These personnel will support the operation of intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft for missions over northern Nigeria and the surrounding area , '' and aid in the search for the missing schoolgirls . Chad is east of Nigeria . Other countries , such as China , France and Britain , have also sent military assistance to the region . According to some reports , Boko Haram started to sell some of the kidnapped girls as brides to militants in May . The value of a girl , according to Boko Haram : $ 12 . The Associated Press cited reports of forced mass weddings which had taken place after the abductions . In a video message , Boko Haram leader Shekau had reportedly announced : `` I abducted your girls . I will sell them in the market , by Allah . '' The hunt for Boko Haram leader Shekau had started well before the mass abductions of the girls . In 2013 , the U.S. State Department added Shekau to its `` Rewards for Justice Program , '' offering up to $ 7 million for information that led to his capture . Those efforts have been unsuccessful . A video which was released this month showed Shekau alive and in freedom . Meanwhile , USAID \u2014 the international development agency of the United States \u2014 has devoted about $ 150 million to programs aimed at providing education to Nigerian children and teenagers . The programs primarily target internally displaced children and others who are affected by the violence in Nigeria . Only 28 percent of primary-age children have ever attended school in Borno , the state in which the kidnappings took place . The low attendance rates in an area partially under the sphere of influence of Boko Haram does not seem to be a coincidence . Boko Haram 's name can be translated as `` Western education is sin .

It \u2019 s common for Chinese people to choose an English name , partly to make conversation with non-Chinese speakers easier .

The article says : \u201c While native English speakers are stuck with whatever happy or unhappy names they \u2019 ve been given , Chinese and other \u2018 non-natives \u2019 get the lucky choice of picking their own English name . \u201c However these choices can mean more than you think ! \u201d Religious , mythical , and fictional characters such as Vampire , Satan , Medusa , and Edward Cullen are a no-no . \u201c Unique names like these aren \u2019 t just very amusing to English speakers , it also suggests you have some connection to that name , \u201d the article warns . \u201c So if you call yourself Satan , you might get a few foreigners thinking you \u2019 re anti-Christian , or possibly a member of a heavy metal band. \u201d CCTV says Harry is OK , if you \u2019 re a Harry Potter fan , but only because it was a common name to start with .

{"claim": "Video showing American journalist beheaded believed real , officials and family say", "evidence": "President Barack Obama denounced Islamic State ( Isis ) militants for murdering an American journalist in retaliation for US air strikes in Iraq , showing an anger he has rarely displayed in remarks about the Iraq conflict . \u201c No just god would stand for what they did yesterday and every single day , \u201d Obama said Wednesday in brief remarks from Edgerton , Massachusetts , where he is vacationing . Hours after US intelligence authenticated a gruesome Isis videotape showing the execution of captive journalist James Foley , an act committed with the goal of deterring future US strikes on Isis , Obama said that Isis \u201c has no place in the 21st century , \u201d and called on allies to help defeat a \u201c cancer so it does not spread. \u201d Obama did not announce any intensification of his bombing campaign , now in its thirteenth day . US Central Command has yet to announce any new strikes since the Tuesday appearance of the social-media-borne Foley video , although sporadic reports from Iraq have indicated some may have taken place Wednesday . An emotional Obama ran through a litany of Isis human-rights abuses , from rape to enslavement , calling them \u201c cowardly acts of violence. \u201d In a vague reference to Americans held captive by Isis or near its path in Iraq , Obama said the US would \u201c do everything we can to protect our people , \u201d a formulation that has preceded US military action in the past . With the death of the first American in Iraq since the US military withdrew in 2011 , pressure is mounting on Obama to expand his already growing and amorphous air war against Isis . The stated purpose of nearly two weeks of bombing has moved from the rescue of mostly Yazidi Iraqi civilians at risk of genocide to providing air cover for Kurdish and Iraqi forces wresting the strategically vital Mosul Dam away from Isis . Aides to Obama pointed out from the start that threats to critical infrastructure would likely prompt a US reprisal . Buffeted between calls to destroy Isis and criticism of their shifting rationale , Obama and the Pentagon have strenuously objected to a charge of mission creep . They point out the consistency of the goals Obama has articulated since 8 August : preventing humanitarian catastrophe and protecting US personnel in Iraq . Yet both are broad enough to encompass aerial protection of Iraqi Kurdistan and the destruction of Isis vehicles , artillery and fixed positions from Mount Sinjar to the Mosul Dam . The murder of Foley \u2013 delivered after he gave a statement at knifepoint blaming the US for his death \u2013 and Isis \u2019 s threat to kill another American journalist , Steven Sotloff , is also testing Obama \u2019 s goal of safeguarding US nationals in a country overrun by Isis . National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said Wednesday that the video showed both Foley and Sotloff . Leaders from the UK , France and other countries lined up to excoriate Isis for the slaying . British prime minister David Cameron called it \u201c shocking \u201d and cut short his summer holiday to chair meetings on a response . A particularly acute concern for the UK government is the British accent heard from Foley \u2019 s masked killer . US intelligence believes hundreds of westerners , including Americans , have joined Isis . In the UK , Scotland Yard \u2019 s counter-terrorism command , SO15 , launched an investigation into the video as leading linguistics experts said the man sounded like he was from London or the south-east of England . The British foreign secretary , Philip Hammond , said of the video : \u201c All the hallmarks point to it being genuine . We \u2019 re very concerned by the apparent fact that the murderer in question is British and we are urgently investigating \u2013 agencies on both sides of the Atlantic \u2013 are first of all looking to authenticate the video , to make sure that it is genuine , and sadly it appears to be , and then to see if we can identify the individual in question. \u201d A spokesman for German chancellor Angela Merkel called Foley \u2019 s murder barbaric . Laurent Fabius , the French foreign minister , said it exposed Isis as the \u201c caliphate of barbarism \u201d . French president Francois Hollande told Le Monde that a global effort \u201c beyond the traditional debate of intervention or non-intervention \u201d was necessary to confront Isis , and proposed an international meeting next month . With a brutality so severe it prompted al-Qaida to divorce it from the terrorist franchise , Isis has fulfilled a jihadist aspiration to carve out a state . It flies a flag , sets up internal police to govern its subjects \u2019 adherence to its interpretation of Islamic laws and customs , and maintains financial viability through the control of seized oil assets . While other jihadist entities employ terrorist and insurgent tactics , for which infiltration of another \u2019 s populace is central , Isis has mustered a highly mobile army that seizes and holds territory . Foley \u2019 s killer emphasized in a propaganda video that Isis is a state , not a terrorist group , a distinction that is fundamental to the group \u2019 s prestige . On Wednesday , Obama repeatedly called Isis \u201c terrorists. \u201d The Committee to Protect Journalists said the murder of Foley , 40 , who went missing during a reporting trip to Syria in 2012 , \u201c sickens all decent people \u201d . \u201c Foley went to Syria to show the plight of the Syrian people , to bear witness to their fight , and in so doing to fight for press freedom , \u201d Sandra Mims Rowe , the group \u2019 s chair , said in a statement . In a Facebook message attributed to her , Foley \u2019 s mother Diane said : \u201c We have never been prouder of our son Jim . He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people. \u201d She also asked the media and the public to respect her family \u2019 s privacy . Obama hailed Foley , who he called Jim , and said he had called Foley \u2019 s parents . Foley \u2019 s murder , Obama said , was \u201c an act of violence that shocks the conscience of the entire world . \u201d", "label": "agree"}

{"claim": "Time Capsule from Paul Revere and Samuel Adams Discovered in Boston", "evidence": "An explosion and a crater reported near the capital of Nicaragua raised suspicions on Monday that a meteorite had split off from an asteroid that passed by Earth this weekend and struck our planet . But NASA scientists have now cast doubt on whether the blast outside Managua was even a meteorite at all . The blast left a hole 40 feet ( 12 meters ) wide and 19 feet ( 5 meters ) deep outside the international airport serving Nicaragua 's capital . Some Nicaraguan astronomers quoted in early news reports attributed the blast to a chip off a weekend asteroid flyby . But outside meteorite experts later downplayed links to the small asteroid , dubbed 2014 RC , which passed harmlessly by Earth over the weekend . About the size of a house , 2014 RC passed within 22,000 miles ( 36,000 kilometers ) of our planet on Sunday . `` Information is limited , but the miss distance of 2014 RC actually precludes any related meteorite impact '' at the Managua crater , says MIT asteroid expert Richard Binzel , by email .

'' ) That meteorite impact sprang from an object roughly the size of 2014 RC exploding in the atmosphere above Russia , with about 500 kilotons of energy , bright enough to sunburn some watchers . A larger asteroid had passed harmlessly over the Southern Hemisphere on the same date . Update : In a late Monday report on RC 2014 , astronomers at NASA 's Near-Earth Object Program based at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California , revised size estimates for the asteroid . Radar observations indicate that the asteroid is about 40 feet ( 12 meters ) across and rotates rapidly , several times a minute . That makes it roughly half the size of the 2013 Russian meteorite . The NASA update also called the meteorite report from Managua `` unrelated '' to RC 2014 , citing the 13-hour difference in the asteroid flyby and the crater explosion . `` As yet , no eyewitness accounts or imagery have come to light of the fireball flash or debris trail that is typically associated with a meteor of the size required to produce such a crater , '' noted the statement .", "label": "unrelated"}

{"claim": "Rumors about Fidel Castro \u2019 s death again circulate on the Internet", "evidence": "HBO is in talks with Apple to make Apple TV one of the launch partners for its highly anticipated streaming service when it debuts next month . HBO and streaming partner Major League Baseball Advanced Media are working to have the standalone service , called \u201c HBO Now , \u201d ready to launch in April in conjunction with the premiere of the fifth season of \u201c Game of Thrones , \u201d according to sources familiar with their plans . When it launches , consumers will be able to subscribe to \u201c HBO Now \u201d directly from HBO for the first time , rather than through a cable , satellite or telco TV distributor such as Comcast or Verizon . The retail price is expected to be $ 15 a month when purchased directly from HBO , or about the that consumers pay when they order HBO through their cable , satellite or telco provider . With \u201c HBO Now , \u201d HBO \u2019 s corporate parent , Time Warner Inc. , is looking to a whole new generation of distributors for HBO such as Apple TV , Roku , Xbox , PlayStation , Amazon and others to help market the service to an estimated 10 million U.S. broadband subscribers who do not pay for a cable TV bundle . CEO Jeff Bewkes has said the offering could also help reach some of the 70 million cable TV subscribers who do not subscribe to HBO but might if given the opportunity to subscribe online . HBO \u2019 s over-the-top service has been cast as the biggest chink yet in the so-called cable bundle , where consumers are required to buy packages of channels , some of which they may never watch . One study claimed the service would lead to a 7 percent drop in pay TV subscribers as users opt of cable and opt-in to HBO Now . But some cable providers , such as Cablevision and Cox Communications , have expressed interest in bundling \u201c HBO Now \u201d with broadband for their own subscribers who don \u2019 t get cable TV . Apple has been most aggressive in courting HBO in a bid to add the service to Apple TV , sources say . Apple TV already carries HBO Go for current HBO subscribers , but it may add a second app for HBO Now . Apple has spent the last several years negotiating for the rights to offer their own linear TV package ; in the meantime , HBO Now is seen as an added service to drive adoption of Apple TV . While HBO has not confirmed a launch date for HBO Now , internally the target is an April launch , in time for the April 12 debut of \u201c Game of Thrones. \u201d That \u2019 s an aggressive timeframe for Major League Baseball Advanced Media , which is building the back-end along with a new front-end separate from HBO Go . HBO is taking care not to launch HBO Now before it can guarantee that the service will work without some of the technical glitches that plagued HBO Go during last fall 's debut of `` Game of Thrones . '' The launch of \u201c HBO Now \u201d will be a milestone for Time Warner \u2019 s premium TV channel , which has for most of its 42-year history been distributed as an add-on to a package of cable channels . The web service will allow HBO to sign on a new group of distribution partners , which it sees as no different than when it added satellite TV and , later , telcos like Verizon and AT & T . Each of those distributors pays a wholesale price for HBO and then resells it to consumers for anywhere from $ 13 to $ 18 a month . Most see HBO as a retention device ; those that subscribe are less likely to drop service or switch providers . HBO and Time Warner declined to comment . At $ 15 a month , HBO Now will be significantly more expensive than Netflix , which ranges from $ 8 to $ 12 a month for various levels of service , but cheaper than some were predicting . HBO makes the case that it has more original programming than Netflix and a better , more current film library . \u201c It \u2019 s a premium product and it will be priced accordingly , \u201d HBO CEO Richard Plepler said during a Time Warner earnings call in February . HBO \u2019 s push to launch HBO Now comes after years of talking about launching an over-the-top service that bypasses traditional cable TV . It has been met with some resistance from current distributors , such as Time Warner Cable and Comcast , two companies in the midst of a $ 46 billion merger , according to sources . But HBO heard the same misgivings from cable when it first added satellite TV providers and then telcos as distributors . HBO \u2019 s strategy is to give early partners a pricing advantage over newer ones ; it \u2019 s unclear how this will go over with Apple , which has a track record of squeezing advantageous deals out of media , including the 99 cent single , more than a decade ago . Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes said in December he saw \u201c cord-cutting \u201d accelerate as pay-TV providers dropped subscribers . U.S. pay TV providers lost 125,000 subscribers in 2014 , according to Leichtman Research Group . At the same time , HBO and Cinemax its highest number of new subscribers -- 2.8 million -- in 30 years . Among the challenges HBO faces to get HBO Now launched is how to avoid confusion with HBO Go , the service that allows HBO \u2019 s TV subscribers to access it on the web , smartphones and tablets . The two services will have separate log-in pages and separate apps , but some cable execs are concerned about customer confusion . The explanation might challenge even the best call center employee : HBO Go is for TV subscribers to watch their content on devices ; HBO Now for those who don \u2019 t subscribe via TV .

Various witnesses have credited Vickers with leading the security response and killing the infiltrator , a man who may have been the same cold-blooded murderer who gunned down an unarmed solider outside the national cenotaph moments before . Anyone who thought Canada \u2019 s Sergeant-At-Arms role was an archaic novelty now understands the man holding the sceptre has a deadly serious job . \u201c It \u2019 s not ceremonial at all , and he has tremendous responsibility \u2014 and he wears it well , \u201d said Mary . In an RCMP career spanning 29 years , Vickers rose up the ranks from a constable in the Northwest Territories to serving ten years in Alberta , and then to chief superintendent in Ottawa . After retiring from the force , he took the Sergeant-At-Arms job on Parliament Hill , and was once famously photographed escorting a protestor masquerading as a page from the House of Commons .

Perth scientists have cast doubt over claims that a spider burrowed into a man 's body during his first trip to Bali . The story went global on Thursday , generating hundreds of stories online .

Mr Thomas said a specialist dermatologist later used tweezers to remove what was believed to be a `` tropical spider '' .

Arachnologist Dr Volker Framenau said whatever the creature was , it was `` almost impossible '' for the culprit to have been a spider . `` If you look at a spider , the fangs , the mouth parts they have , they are not able to burrow . They ca n't get through skin , '' he said . `` We thought it may have been something like a mite , there are a few different parasitic mites out there , which can sometimes look a bit like a spider . I ca n't think of any spider which could do this to a person . '' Dr Mark Harvey from the Western Australian Museum agreed and said he found the case `` bizarre '' . `` I must confess I was amazed because I 've never heard of a spider being able to survive under the skin of a human , or indeed any mammal , '' he said . `` Spiders need air to breathe , they have spiracles on the sides of their bodies where air comes into their system through a series of what we call book lungs . Being under the skin of somebody , I would have thought they would n't have enough air to survive . `` Even if it was a mite , I 've never seen anything like this . Even if it was an insect , I 've never heard of an insect crawling under the skin like this , so it really is a remarkable case . '' Dr Harvey said spiders were widely feared in the community and often were the subject of urban legends . `` We hear about people going on holidays and having spiders lay eggs under the skin . Then [ the baby spiders ] burst out when they return from their holiday in the tropics , '' he said . `` None of those are true , they 're just made up stories . `` They 're not actually able to dig through the skin , that 's why this case is so unusual . Some can burrow into soil , but they have to remove soil particles one at a time if they want to do that . '' Something which is true , according to Dr Harvey , is that certain arachnids do `` live on humans '' . `` We all have mites living on our faces . They 're follicle mites , but they 're absolutely miniscule and you ca n't see them . We transmit them to our children when we have kids , '' he said . `` They live in the bases of hair follicles on our faces and in some of the pores in our skin . Those mites are so small , you ca n't see them , and they 're not going to cause a blemish on the skin like this lad has on his stomach . '' Dr Framenau said that much of the confusion could be eliminated by keeping or catching the creepy crawly offender , dead or alive , and enlisting the help of experts . `` It would be great if they collected it or took a photo of it , '' he said . `` If you have been bitten by something , the best thing you can do is collect it and submit it to a museum for identification before these things go viral .

Conal O'Rourke is going after Comcast and its controller , Lawrence Salva , for defamation , and arguing the company violated federal regulations with its poor service and overbilling . In his complaint , O'Rourke alleges that Salva , a former partner at PWC , called up an executive at PWC 's Philadelphia office and used Comcast 's leverage as a major client to have O'Rourke investigated for `` ethics violations '' and ultimately fired . O'Rourke says Comcast and Salva defamed him by telling his employer he threw PNC 's name around on the phone in an attempt to get his Comcast service issues resolved\u2014he claims he never told anyone at Comcast who he worked for , and he wants Comcast to release tapes and emails from his interactions with the controller 's office prove it . Oh , and about those service issues : O'Rourke 's complaint also argues Comcast 's mistreatment of him as a customer violated the Cable Communications Policy Act , and lists some particularly egregious examples : Comcast habitually misspelled Mr. O'Rourke 's name as Mr. O'Kourke , making it difficult for him to receive his Comcast bills in a timely fashion , because the postal service would fail to deliver them . Ultimately , Mr. O'Rourke convinced the postal service to deliver mail to him that was addressed to `` Mr. O'Kourke , '' after he was unable to convince Comcast to even correct the spelling of his name . In addition to Comcast 's continual failure to address Mr. O'Rourke 's billing issues , in late November or early December of 2013 , when Mr. O'Rourke was out of town , Comcast shipped Mr. O'Rourke twelve random pieces of Comcast equipment . Comcast then proceeded to charge Mr. O'Rourke almost $ 2,000 in fees for equipment that he had neither requested nor wanted . When he tried to get help with these issues , he says , Comcast sent him to collections . That 's when he took his complaint directly to the controller , and allegedly lost his job as a result . He says he never received a single correct bill in the entire year he was a Comcast customer .

PROBABLY FALSE Example : [ Collected via email , September 2014 ] Seeking truth in stir of 11 missing / stolen commercial airliners from the Libyan airport during the fall of Tripoli . Origins : In early August 2014 , some North African bloggers began to spread stories that several commercial airliners were missing from the Tripoli International Airport during or shortly after the facility was taken over by Zintan militia forces earlier in the summer . Later that month translations of the blog posts began to be picked up by news outlets in Western Europe and passed on as fact rather than gossip ; by early September those tales of translations of blogs had spread to the United States under the guise of real news . The use of airplanes as terrorist weapons in 2001 makes it all too easy for us to anticipate their being used that way again . And despite denials from all sides \u2014 the airlines who are not missing any planes , the Libyan transport ministry , and the anti-government forces in control of the airport \u2014 the tales have found a ready audience among a populace already on edge in anticipation of the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks . However , there have been no statements from the State Department , the Department of Defense , Homeland Security , or any other authority warning of stolen airliners . The national threat level has not been raised . Algerian and Moroccan military and air defense , already on high alert due to the unrest just across their borders with Libya , would undoubtedly have noticed multiple flights of unidentified passenger aircraft . < ! -- google_ad_client = `` pub-6608306193529351 '' ; google_ad_width = 468 ; google_ad_height = 60 ; google_ad_format = `` 468x60_as '' ; google_ad_type = `` text '' ; google_ad_channel = `` 0054321535 '' ; google_color_border = `` 000000 '' ; // -- >", "label": "unrelated"}

However , it is his description about God that is bound to spark a hot debate about the almighty .

According to the 71-year-old man of God , the supreme entity isn \u2019 t a man , as is popularly assumed and believed .

Father John Micheal O \u2019 neal had the chance to meet with the divine when he was rushed to a hospital late last month owing to a massive heart attack . However , Father O \u2019 Neal was declared clinically dead shortly after his arrival . Not one to give up hope so easily , doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital kept the blood flowing to his brain with the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2 . While the blood flowed with the help of modern science , doctors worked tirelessly to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm . Consistent with near-death experiences , Father O \u2019 Neal entered heaven through a gate made of bright light and encountered God . However , instead of the all-mighty father figure , the priest claims he was warmly greeted by a motherly figure . Father O \u2019 Neal describes the divine entity as \u201c mother-like \u2018 Being of Light . ' \u201d \u201c Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting . She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother \u2019 s embrace . The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn \u2019 t disturb me , she is everything I hoped she would be and even more ! \u201d As expected , the priest \u2019 s claims about the gender of God has created quite a stir amidst devote Catholics . The intense discussion between the catholic clergy of the archdiocese about the \u201c experience \u201d of the father and the ramifications of his revelations persuaded the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors . Though his superiors have disapproved , Father O \u2019 Neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the \u201c Holy Mother. \u201d \u201c I wish to continue preaching . I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother , the Son and the Holy Ghost with all Catholics and even all Christians .

{"claim": "Comcast blocks Tor", "evidence": "Years ago , I had a job in China where I evaluated the spoken English of college students . One bright young woman introduced herself to me with her Chinese name . Then she added : `` You can call me 'Easy . ' That 's my English name . '' I paused , thought for a moment , and then decided to say something . `` You might want to consider changing your name , '' I said , explaining\u2014as delicately as possible\u2014that `` easy '' was an unfortunate name for a woman . Mortified , she thanked me for the tip . `` I 'm going to go and change my name now , '' she said . People in China have adopted English names for decades . Many choose ones that resemble their birth names : Chinese boys named `` Da Wei , '' a common name , almost invariably become `` David . '' Others find inspiration from singers , athletes , politicians , or movie stars . In my first year in China , I taught five different boys called `` Tom Hanks , '' thanks in part to Castaway 's success . Most of the `` English '' names I encountered were conventional , though others\u2014like the aforementioned `` Easy '' \u2014were less than appropriate . ( I also taught a boy named `` Fish '' who , perhaps inspired by a certain musical artist , preferred to render his name by drawing it . ) Sweets-inspired names are `` typically thought of as \u2018 non-smart girl \u2019 names , or \u2018 stripper \u2019 names . '' CCTV , China 's state-run broadcaster , wants to solve this problem . In an article published by its English-language channel , the network laid out a series of guidelines for how not to name yourself . For example , avoid naming yourself after a food item ( `` Candy '' ) , a famous person ( `` Obama '' ) , or a very old person ( `` Gertrude '' ) . If you name yourself `` Satan , '' says CCTV , people might think you 're anti-Christian , or worse , a `` member of a heavy metal band . '' Proper and traditional names , like `` Michael , '' `` William , '' and `` Elizabeth , '' on the other hand , imply you 're from a fancy and conservative family . Sweets-inspired names are `` typically thought of as \u2018 non-smart girl \u2019 names , or \u2018 stripper \u2019 names . '' One wonders if certain American celebrities might not also benefit from these guidelines . For instance , here 's what CCTV has to say about using food as a name : '' Food is very hit or miss .

John Moore / Getty Images Two Republican lawmakers told BuzzFeed News Wednesday suspected terrorists have infiltrated the U.S.\u2013Mexico border and as many as 10 fighters have been captured , but Homeland Security officials deny any such thing has happened . Rep. Jason Chaffetz , a Republican from Utah , said four alleged terror suspects were captured on Sept. 10 in Texas . In an interview Wednesday , Chaffetz said the men flew from a Middle Eastern country to Mexico City , where they paid a smuggler to take them to and across the border .

Chaffetz would not reveal his source of the information , but said he confirmed it with government officials . \u201c I had an informant tell me about it and then I questioned the Secretary of Homeland Security , \u201d he said . \u201c I have no doubt about its authenticity. \u201d The four alleged terror suspects had affiliations with groups other than the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) , Chaffetz said . He added that they were still being held in Texas as of Wednesday . youtube.com California Rep. Duncan Hunter , a Republican who represents San Diego County , made headlines Tuesday when he said to Fox News \u2019 Greta Van Susteren that he had \u201c asked Border Patrol \u201d about terrorists and learned that several had been captured . Hunter claimed 10 terror suspects had been caught near the border , including four people allegedly captured in September . \u201c I know at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas , \u201d he said on the program . Hunter \u2019 s spokesman Joe Kasper told BuzzFeed News the congressman \u2019 s assertion that 10 terror suspects had been captured along the border included the same four people described by Chaffetz . Kasper claimed four other suspects had been captured within the last 36 hours , and pointed to a Judicial Watch story that allegedly \u201c confirmed \u201d the most recent captures to back up his assertion .

DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border . But Hunter isn \u2019 t buying that explanation . His spokesman told BuzzFeed News Wednesday that they have evidence from reliable sources about \u201c foreign nationals \u201d being captured along the border .

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary , 24 , was known as L Jinny or Lyricist Jinn at home in London , where his rising music career saw him appear in videos and have his singles played on BBC Radio in 2012 . He came to national attention earlier this year , when he posted a picture of himself holding a severed head on Twitter after resurfacing in Syria . The gruesome picture , believed to have been taken in the Isis stronghold of Raqqa , was captioned : \u201c Chillin \u2019 with my homie or what \u2019 s left of him. \u201d Bary reportedly travelled to the country last year from Maida Vale , west London , where he lived with his mother and five siblings .

{"claim": "Luke Somers 'killed in failed rescue attempt in Yemen '", "evidence": "A British-born U.S. photojournalist held by al-Qaida militants in Yemen has been killed in a failed rescue attempt , his sister has revealed today . Luke Somers had been held hostage since September 2013 in Yemen 's capital Sana'a having moved to the country two years earlier . His sister Lucy told Associated Press that she learned of her 33-year-old brother 's death from FBI agents at 5am this morning . 'We ask that all of Luke 's family members be allowed to mourn in peace , ' she said from London . Scroll down for video Lucy Somers said she learned of her 33-year-old brother Luke Somers ' death from FBI agents There was no immediate comment from Washington , nor from security officials in Yemen 's capital , Sana'a . Earlier this week al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) issued a video with a message aimed at the US government threatening to kill the hostage if its demands were not met . Last week the U.S. said it had attempted a rescue operation to free a number of hostages , including Mr Somers , but that he had not been at the site of the raid . The family of Mr Somers had earlier pleaded for him to be released . In an online video Miss Somers described her older brother as a romantic who 'always believes the best in people . ' She added : 'Please let him live . ' British-born U.S. photojournalist Luke Somers ( pictured ) , who was being held by al-Qaida militants in Yemen , has been killed in a failed rescue attempt , his sister has revealed today Luke Somers was kidnapped in September 2013 from Yemen 's capital Sana'a ( shown in the map above ) Mr Somers moved from London to Sana'a , Yemen in 2011 to become a teacher , but soon started taking pictures of public demonstrations and established himself as a photojournalist working for the Yemen Times His father Michael said Mr Somers was 'a good friend of Yemen and the Yemeni people ' . It came after the release of the AQAP video which begins with a reading in Arabic from Nasser bin Ali al Ansi , an AQAP official , before Mr Somers appears and gives a statement in English . He said : 'My name is Luke Somers . I 'm 33 years old . I was born in England , but I carry American citizenship and have lived in America for most of my life . 'It 's now been well over a year since I 've been kidnapped in Sana'a . Basically , I 'm looking for any help that can get me out of this situation . I 'm certain that my life is in danger . 'So as I sit here now , I ask if anything can be done , please let it be done . Thank you very much . ' Al Ansi gave the US government three days to meet the demands or 'otherwise , the American hostage held by us will meet his inevitable fate ' . The three-minute video also features Ansi speaking about American activity in Afghanistan , Somalia and Iraq as well as recent air strikes in Syria . It follows similar videos by another extremist militant group , Islamic State ( IS ) , which has already killed two British hostages and three American hostages in videos released on social media . Militants released a video on Thursday that showed Mr Somers , threatening to kill him in three days if the United States did not meet the group 's demands Nasser bin Ali al Ansi , senior official in Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , pictured , spoke for two minutes and thirty seconds during the video where he threatened to kill Mr Somers within three days IS has posted a series of videos online showing the separate murders of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff , US aid worker Peter Kassig and two British aid workers , David Haines and Alan Henning . Footage claiming to show Mr Henning 's murder appeared on the internet just days after the UK joined US-led air strikes against the terrorists in Iraq . The news of the failed rescue comes after a suspected U.S. drone strike in Yemen killed nine alleged al-Qaida militants early Saturday , a security official said . The drone struck at dawn in Yemen 's southern Shabwa province , hitting a suspected militant hideout , the official said . The official did not elaborate and spoke on condition of anonymity as he was n't authorised to brief journalists . At least six suspected militants were killed in an airstrike in the same province last month . Later Saturday , tribal leaders said they saw helicopters flying over an area called Wadi Abdan in Shabwa province . American authorities rarely discuss their drone strike campaign in Yemen . The strikes are incredibly unpopular in Yemen due to civilian casualties , legitimising for many the attacks on American interests . American commandos tried to rescue Mr Somers in a raid on an AQAP camp late last month , but he had been moved by the time they arrived Begging for mercy : Luke 's brother , Jordan ( left ) , and his mother , Paula Somers ( right ) , released a video on Thursday asking his al-Qaeda captors to release him In a statement on Thursday , Pentagon press secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby acknowledged for the first time that a mysterious U.S. raid last month had sought to rescue Mr Somers but that he turned out not to be at the site . Kirby did not elaborate on the joint U.S-Yemeni operation to free Mr Somers , saying details remained classified . However , officials have said the raid targeted a remote al-Qaida safe haven in a desert region near the Saudi border . Eight captives - including Yemenis , a Saudi and an Ethiopian - were freed . Mr Somers , a Briton and four others had been moved days earlier . Mr Somers was kidnapped in September 2013 as he left a supermarket in the Yemeni capital , Sana'a , said Fakhri al-Arashi , chief editor of the National Yemen , where Mr Somers worked as a copy editor and a freelance photographer during the 2011 uprising in Yemen .

{"claim": "Big Bank Hank , co-founder of the Sugarhill Gang , has died", "evidence": "BEIRUT : A statement attributed to the Islamic State group claimed an American female hostage was killed in a Jordanian airstrike on Friday on the outskirts of the northern Syrian city of Raqqa , the extremist group 's main stronghold . The statement identified the woman as Kayla Jean Mueller and said she was killed during Muslim prayers - which usually take place around midday on Fridays - in airstrikes that targeted `` the same location for more than an hour . '' No Islamic State militants were killed in the airstrikes , the statement further claimed . It published photos allegedly of the bombed site , showing a severely damaged brown colored three-story building - but no images of the woman . American officials said they were looking into the report , and the White House said it did not have immediate comment . There was also no immediate comment from the Jordanian government . The IS statement could not be independently verified . It appeared on a militant website commonly used by IS and was also distributed by IS-affiliated Twitter users . Mueller , of Prescott , Arizona , had been working in Turkey assisting Syrian refugees , according to a 2013 article in The Daily Courier , her hometown newspaper . The 26-year-old told the paper that she was drawn to help with the situation in Syria . `` For as long as I live , I will not let this suffering be normal , '' she said . `` It 's important to stop and realize what we have , why we have it and how privileged we are . And from that place , start caring and get a lot done . '' According to the local paper , Mueller had been working with the humanitarian aid agency Support to Life , as well as a local NGO that helped female Syrian refugees develop skills . A 2007 article about Mueller from the same local newspaper said she was a student at Northern Arizona University and was active in the Save Darfur Coalition . On Sunday , President Barack Obama said the U.S. was `` deploying all the assets that we can '' to find Mueller . `` We are in very close contact with the family trying to keep them updated , '' he said in an interview with NBC 's Today Show . `` Obviously this is something that is heart-breaking for the family and we want to make sure we do anything we can to make sure that any American citizen is rescued from this situation . '' Her identity had not been disclosed out of fears for her safety . If her death is confirmed , she would be the fourth American to die while in the captivity of the Islamic State militants . Three other Americans , journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid worker Peter Kassig were beheaded by the group . Jordan , which is part of a U.S.-led coalition bombing Islamic State group targets in Syria , stepped up its attacks after IS announced it had killed a captive Jordanian pilot . The Syrian government said Thursday that dozens of Jordanian fighter jets had bombed Islamic State training centers and weapons storage sites . It did not say where the attacks occurred . There was no word from the Jordanian government on whether its planes had struck Raqqa on Friday . But activists who monitor the Syrian conflict from inside the country said U.S.-led coalition planes hit several targets on the edges and outskirts of Raqqa , in quick succession on Friday .", "label": "unrelated"}

In a lengthy article by The Washington Post , identifying the man suspected of appearing in videos showing the beheading of US and UK hostages , a 2010 report in The Independent is cited , which details claims that Emwazi was detained for 'days ' and illegally interrogated by MI5 while on a safari holiday in Africa , before being let go . It has now been claimed Emwazi started to become radicalised following the events on this trip . Below is the full report , in which Emwazi is identified as Muhammad ibn Muazzam , from The Independent on Saturday , 01 May , 2010 . British Muslims on safari 'stopped by MI5 ' ( from The Independent on 01/05/2010 ) MI5 agents illegally interrogated British Muslims who were detained while on safari holidays in Africa , it was claimed yesterday . The new allegations mirror cases first raised by The Independent last year in which the security service was accused of harassing and intimidating north London community workers who had returned from Somalia . Now two British men from west London who visited Tanzania for a week-long safari in May last year say they were arrested and held for \u201c days \u201d in inhumane detention on the orders of MI5 . Abu Talib and Muhammad ibn Muazzam , both in their mid-20s , and a German friend travelling with them , allege they were threatened with beatings by members of Tanzania 's security forces . After being refused entry to Tanzania they were returned to the Netherlands , where they say they were questioned by MI5 agents who accused them of having links to Islamic extremists . On their return to the UK the next day , the men allege they were harassed by MI5 , who warned them they were now on a terror watch list which prevented them travelling to any Muslim country . Another British citizen , Abu Omar , 19 , says that in April 2009 his safari holiday to Kenya was interrupted when the house in which he was staying was raided by local security officers . Mr Omar claims he was held and questioned for four days , also on the basis of intelligence supplied by MI5 . He alleges that his interrogators threw a mobile phone at him which they said had his fingerprints on and was linked to phone calls made to Osama bin Laden . Back in London Mr Omar was further questioned by MI5 , who took his fingerprints and photographs . He told the human rights group Cageprisoners : `` I was left in the airport without money , barefoot and my clothes in bin liners . '' The new cases bear striking similarities to allegations made by six youth workers from Kentish Town who allege that they too were harassed and unlawfully interrogated after holidays abroad in 2008 . Cageprisoners ' executive director , Asim Qureshi , said : `` The last seven years of the 'War on Terror ' have seen the profiling and criminalisation of the Arab and Pakistani communities by UK authorities around the world . The policies implemented through counter-terrorism legislation and Prevent [ the Government 's strategy for combating extremism in the Muslim community ] have been counter-productive as Muslim communities feel marginalised . Many Muslims feel besieged and the policies of Government have done nothing to temper that . '' A government spokeswoman said the Security Service `` operated within the law '' and complaints about officers ' alleged behaviour should be made to the independent commissioner who has the power to investigate allegations .", "label": "discuss"}

And the plumber from Texas City , Texas , says he certainly would never willingly aid fundamentalist rebels . So it 's hard for him to understand how his Ford F-250 pickup truck - including his logo for Mark-1 Plumbing and his phone number - wound up being in a photo posted on Twitter by the extremist Ansar al-Deen Front from the front lines of the war in Syria . Mr Oberholtzer says he 's been getting hundreds of phone calls and faxes since the Ansar al-Deen Front tweeted a picture of what appeared to be his old truck with an anti-aircraft gun in the back , according to the Galveston County Daily News . However , it remains to be seen if the photo is entirely authentic , with a new video surfacing which suggests the photo could have been digitally altered . Scroll down for video This truck , once owned by Mark-1 Plumbing in Texas City , Texas , is seen here in an Islamist propaganda photo . It 's unclear if it has gone all the way to Syria or whether the photo has been digitally altered This photo , taken from a propaganda video , shows a near identical scene featuring a different truck , raising questions as to the authenticity of the photo featuring Mr Oberholtzer 's truck The Islamist forces fighting across the region are known for their advanced and technical digital propaganda campaigns . The video , featuring a different vehicle firing from exactly the same position , raises the possibility Mr Oberholtzer 's vehicle may have been photoshopped into a video frame . Superimposing a better vehicle and gun into a still frame from the original video would be significantly easier than trying to alter the video itself . This could be why the video features an older model car and weapon , but the photo features Mr Oberholtzer 's later-model Toyota . Despite this , people have now been making hateful phone calls to Mr Oberholtzer 's company in the mistaken belief he is supporting the fundamentalists . 'A few of the people are really ugly , ' he told the newspaper . Some threatened his life . Mr Oberholtzer says he has hired a lawyer and wants to make Twitter remove the posting , CBS News reports . He says he sold the truck to an AutoNation dealership three years ago . In the past when he sold his work trucks , he always removed the logo first . The last time he got rid of a vehicle he did n't . Mark Oberholtzer says he has no idea how Islamists in Syria could have got hold of his truck Mr Oberholtzer , who has worked as a plumber for the past 32-years , assumed AutoNation would remove the decal before selling the truck . Apparently it did n't . It 's still unknown how the truck could have made its way into the possession of Islamist fighters in Syria . A spokesman for AutoNation told KHOU 11 News that the truck went to auction , and probably different owners over and over , before it may have ended up in the hands of Islamic terrorists . Oberholtzer wants the death threats and the phone to stop ringing . 'We have a secretary here , she 's scared to death . We all have families . We do n't want no problems , ' said Oberholtzer . CBS News reports that the band of Ansar al-Deen seen in the photo mostly hail from Chechnya in Russia . While most fighters are Islamic extremists , the group has not reportedly allied itself with ISIS in Syria . ISIS : The terror group has expanded how and why it recruits new members and is specifically targeting sympathizers abroad And while it is not known how fighters with ISIS could have come to own a Texan plumber 's truck , the terror group is trying to expand how it recruits fighters to its ranks . The extremist organization also has been targeting its sophisticated propaganda to entice potential wives and professionals such as doctors , accountants and engineers in its efforts to build a new society . Among those it has lured were three teenage girls from Colorado , who set out for Syria this fall after swapping Twitter messages about marriage and religion with IS recruiters , and a young woman who sought to fight there - or failing that , to use her nursing skills . It 's a diverse pool of recruits whose motives perplex Western governments seeking to combat the flow . The group 'is issuing a bit of a siren song through social media , trying to attract people to their so-called caliphate , ' FBI Director James Comey told reporters . 'And among the people they 're trying to attract are young women to be brides for these jihadis . ' The group conscripts children for battle , recruits Westerners for acts of jihad and releases videotapes of beheadings . But it also uses propaganda with a humanitarian appeal , such as photos of bombed-out Syrian villages coupled with pleas for help . Video images of smiling children being given treats and enjoying stuffed animals paint a family-friendly portrait that suggests roles within the proto-state for wives and mothers . Justice Department officials say people aiding the Islamic State understand what they 're getting into and risk prosecution , whether or not they venture to Syria and even if they do n't plan to take up arms themselves . Prosecutors have criminally charged more than 15 people in connection with supporting Islamic militant groups . Advance : Militant Islamist fighters wave flags as they take part in a military parade along the streets of Syria 's northern Raqqa province in June A Rochester , New York , food store owner stands accused of trying to arrange for others to travel to Syria and of plotting to kill members of the U.S. military . An Illinois man , allegedly determined to join militants , left behind a letter saying he was disgusted by Western society . And prosecutors say a North Carolina man asked Allah online for martyrdom . Most charges are brought under a statute that makes it illegal to provide 'material support ' - including money , training or a false identity - to a designated terrorist group . Defense lawyers argued the law is overly broad and ensnares the misguided as often as it sweeps up the dangerous . Courts , however , have accepted an expansive interpretation of the law . 'We need to make clear that if you want to go over there and join a terrorist group , you 're likely to end up instead in jail , ' Carlin said . Justice Department officials say they 're also trying strategies other than prosecution , including trying to identify potential recruits before they go . FBI agents in Colorado met repeatedly with Shannon Conley , a 19-year-old nurse 's aide who had converted to Islam , hoping to dissuade her from traveling to Syria to marry a militant suitor she met online . Agents suggested she try humanitarian work instead of jihad , but she told them that if she could n't fight , she would use her skills as a nurse 's aide to help militant fighters , according to court documents . Conley pleaded guilty in September and faces sentencing next month . Her lawyer , Robert Pepin , has said she was 'led terribly astray ' while pursuing her religion and was 'saved ' by her arrest . Perhaps no case better shows the penetration of the recruitment campaign than that of the three Colorado girls , all from East African immigrant families , who were radicalized online and headed for Syria in October . The self-styled 'caliphate ' declared by the Islamic State group bridging Iraq and Syria is starting to show signs of strain A review of the girls ' social media use , which included thousands of Twitter messages and postings on other sites , by the SITE Intelligence Group shows they were in contact with online jihadists from around the world and were deeply interested in marriage and the role of women . As recruiters interacted with the girls , their typical teenage banter about friends and school became replaced with discussions of religion , paradise and death , the review showed . Six months before they went overseas , one girl wrote that she wanted to get married as soon as possible and her friends wished her well , telling her they hoped she got an 'amazing husband because you do not deserve anything else ! ' One female recruiter told prospects to expect to marry quickly and expect to live a domestic life , as it is 'completely impossible for women to participate in battle , ' according to SITE . Women are expected to marry the fighters and bear their children , she explained . Another recruiter told a 16-year-old girl who inquired about joining that 'everyone is welcome , ' according to the report . U.S. officials say even comparatively benign motives for supporting the Islamic State are troubling . 'I 'm not sure we 've seen someone who 's gone over there who 's not attracted to the jihadi cause , ' Carlin said .", "label": "unrelated"}

{"claim": "What Glenn Beck Fears May Be Done With the 11 Missing Jets", "evidence": "Several Iraqi news sources , including Al Sabah and the website al-Maalomah , reported on Wednesday that several ISIS fighters sought help at a hospital in Mosul , 250 miles north of the city of Baghdad , after developing symptoms of Ebola virus infection . Citing anonymous sources in a hospital in Mosul , Al-Sabah reported that two cases of Ebola and 26 cases of HIV/AIDS were confirmed by health authorities in Mosul . The newspaper also claimed that ISIS recruits from some African countries brought the virus to Iraq . The International Business Times UK also carried a similar report , quoting Iraqi news sources . But a spokesperson for the Iraqi health ministry , Ahmed Rudaini , has denied reports that two cases of Ebola virus infection were diagnosed among ISIS militants in Mosul . The Iraqi health ministry spokesperson said the infection could n't have been confirmed in Mosul because none of the hospitals in the city have the diagnostic facilities . He said only the Central Laboratory of Public Health in Baghdad has the ability to confirm cases of Ebola virus infection . Responding to inquiries from Mashable , a WHO spokesperson , Christy Feigh , said , `` We have no official notification that it is Ebola . '' Feigh said the WHO was investigating the reports and would give assistance if needed . But because UN workers are banned from entering ISIS-held areas in Iraq and Syria , it is unclear how the organization would be able to confirm the report or render assistance in suspected cases . Mashable , however , reports that a Kurdish official who appeared convinced that the reports were accurate told the Kurdish news outlet Xendan that the militants reported at the hospital in Mosul with symptoms of Ebola virus infection . While Iraqi health officials are probably not taking the reports seriously , an outbreak of Ebola among ISIS militants could have serious consequences due to lack of access to the ISIS-held areas . It is also feared that ISIS militants could use the presence of the virus among its militants as a terror weapon against opponents , further complicating the prosecution of the war against the extremist group . However , the symptoms of Ebola virus , including vomiting , diarrhea and bleeding in the late stages of the disease are similar to those of several other diseases , including malaria , yellow fever and typhoid fever . Thus , it is possible that the militants who reported at the hospital in Mosul were suffering from other diseases that have symptoms similar to Ebola . Given the fact that the reports were carried exclusively on pro-government newspapers , it is not possible to rule out that they were designed to cause confusion among ISIS fighters and discourage new recruits from joining the group . It is not known that ISIS has a significant number of recruits from West African countries where the epidemic has been reported . Thousands of foreign recruits to ISIS arrived mostly from North African countries such as Tunisia , Libya , Egypt , Algeria and Somalia where there have been no reports of Ebola outbreak . The Ebola virus epidemic has claimed thousands of lives in the West African countries of Sierra Leone , Liberia and Guinea . Recently , Nigerian news sources reported that ISIS was making efforts to recruit fighters from the country . The report led the Nigerian government to issue a statement urging some Middle Eastern countries to carry out thorough background checks on Nigerians applying for visas . The report that some ISIS militants might have contracted Ebola comes a few weeks after Benjamin T. Decker , intelligence analyst and Iraq specialist with the Middle East research firm Levantine Group , said that ISIS executed about 11 doctors in Mosul for refusing to treat wounded militants . Mosul was among several cities ISIS fighters captured earlier in the year 2014 . The militants declared an Islamic caliphate in the areas they captured . Mosul , in particular , has been under ISIS control since June 2014 . The city has reportedly suffered food , water and power shortages since extremist militants took over . Residents have suffered brutal treatment with reports of executions and enslavement of minorities women and children . On Wednesday , the US and its allies carried out 17 airstrikes in Syria and 12 in Iraq . The airstrikes in Syria targeted ISIS facilities in Al Raqqah , Dayr az Zawr and Kobani , while the strikes in Iraq hit ISIS buildings and positions around Mosul , Fallujah and Sinja .", "label": "unrelated"}
{"claim": "Official : Gitmo prisoner traded for Bergdahl reaching out to Taliban", "evidence": "A Guantanamo Bay prisoner released last year as part of an exchange for captured US serviceman Bowe Bergdahl has resumed contact with the Taliban , according to reports . The former detainee - one of five men released in a controversial deal which saw the return of the US PoW from Afghanistan - is said to have been in touch with members of the al-Qaeda linked Haqqani network . This is the first suggestion that any of the detainees involved in the swap may be trying to engage again in militant activity . The five , who mostly held mid- to high-level positions within the Taliban before their capture during the early days of the US-led war in Afghanistan , were detained because of their association with the terror group . Since their release they have been living in Qatar , which promised to monitor the men on behalf of the US . The Pentagon said Thursday that it is working with Qatar and is confident that any threat posed by the former detainees can be mitigated . US Sen Lindsey Graham , who recently visited Qatar , said he had been afraid that one of the detainees had left the country , but said he was assured during his visit that all five remain in the small Gulf nation . Qatar gained public praise from President Barack Obama for brokering the controversial deal in May 2014 that freed Army Sgt . Bergdahl from Taliban captivity in exchange for the release of the five senior Taliban officials who had been imprisoned for years at the US-run Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba . Qatar promised Mr Obama it would keep the five under watch for one year , although they would then be free to leave . `` It 's just a year deal , '' Mr Graham told The Associated Press on Wednesday . `` Just as sure as we 're sitting here , they 're going back to the fight . '' `` They 've had some Haqqani people come to meet with them . ... They 're reaching out . The Taliban five are communicating with people inside Afghanistan . '' However , Mr Graham , a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a leading Capitol Hill voice on foreign policy , said all five are still in Qatar . `` I was afraid one had left , but they told me they 're all still there , '' he said . The Pentagon said in a statement that it would not comment on specific cases involving the detainees . `` However , we take any incidence of re-engagement very seriously , and we work in close coordination through military , intelligence , law enforcement and diplomatic channels to mitigate re-engagement and to take follow-on action when necessary , '' the statement said . `` The Defense Department has a close security partnership with the government of Qatar . We 're confident in our ability to continue to mitigate any threat that may be posed by the former Guantanamo detainees . '' Haqqani operates in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region and has been one of the deadliest threats to US troops in the war . The network , which the State Department designated as a foreign terrorist organisation in 2012 , claims allegiance to the Afghan Taliban , yet operates with some degree of autonomy .", "label": "discuss"}

{"claim": "Soldier shot in Ottawa at War Memorial", "evidence": "Google Inc. plans to buy about half of Redwood City 's mammoth Pacific Shores Center office campus in a stunning deal that could reshuffle the Peninsula real estate scene . Even by the standards of Google \u2019 s relentless real-estate acquisition spree , this is a big one . The world 's biggest search-engine company is buying six office buildings totaling nearly a million square feet , according to several industry sources who were not willing to talk about the deal publicly . The project is owned by the Blackstone Group and Starwood Capital and managed by Equity Office . The purchase \u2014 which could close later this month \u2014 would be Mountain View-based Google \u2019 s most dramatic real estate move this year . It opens up another front in the search giant \u2019 s rapid Peninsula expansion after big deals in Palo Alto and Sunnyvale . And it provides a potential seaborne solution to increasingly gridlocked highways : Pacific Shores is spitting distance from the Port of Redwood City , where Google has been experimenting with commuter ferries as a way to reduce the demands on its extensive bus network . Google declined to comment . Blackstone didn \u2019 t respond to a request for comment . I \u2019 m told the sale is close to being finalized , though it \u2019 s still possible the deal could still fall through . Google 's deposit is n't yet non-refundable , a customary marker for a deal headed toward the finish line , a person familiar with the transaction said . \u201c If any deal is done by anyone , we \u2019 d welcome them to Redwood City , \u201d Mayor Jeffrey Gee told me in a phone call on Friday , adding that he \u2019 d wait to comment on Google \u2019 s potential arrival until a deal is complete . Brokers said the impact of the acquisition , if completed , would ripple through the commercial real estate market . Assuming Google intends to occupy the space , tenants currently in the buildings \u2014 which are more than 90 percent leased \u2014 would have to find new space as their leases end . And Google tends to grow wherever it puts down roots . \u201c It adds fuel to the fire for more spec buildings to start coming out of the ground , because there \u2019 s going to be that much more pressure on space demand , \u201d said Tim Grant , a veteran Bay Area office broker with Avison Young in Foster City . The deal would mark another sign of tech companies taking a shine to the north Peninsula , coming just weeks after Box Inc. agreed to lease a major office project in downtown Redwood City . \u201c This is one more thing , \u201d Grant said . \u201c We \u2019 ve always been thought of as , \u2018 Maybe , but I \u2019 d rather be in San Francisco or ( southern ) Silicon Valley. \u2019 Suddenly , the middle maybe isn \u2019 t a bad place to be. \u201d Google is expected to buy Blackstone and Starwood \u2019 s buildings at 1200 , 1300 , 1600 , 1700 , 1800 and 1900 Seaport Blvd. , which total 934,000 square feet and are home to tenants such as Zazzle Inc. and Rocket Fuel . Google is not buying 2000 and 2100 Seaport Blvd. , the owner-occupied headquarters of Informatica Corp . Nor is Google buying 1400 and 1500 Seaport Blvd. , which includes DreamWorks . Those buildings are owned by Shorenstein , which has been in contract for a while to sell them to San Francisco-based investor DivcoWest , according to sources and public records . The price Google will pay was not immediately clear , but an observer estimated it at \u201c substantially more \u201d than the $ 525 per square foot that Informatica paid for the two buildings it bought in 2012 . One of the Valley \u2019 s marquee campuses , Pacific Shores was built by Jay Paul Co. in the early 2000s and broke new ground for its sleek design and swanky amenities including pools , a rock-climbing wall , day spa and baseball diamonds . It was one of the first major developments that showed multiple tech companies would share the same campus , and rose taller than the one- and two-story buildings that were the standard for tech . Starwood bought the campus in 2006 for about $ 833 million , and immediately sold Shorenstein its two buildings . Blackstone came into the picture after acquiring the junior debt on the property a couple of years ago . A new owner could build even more office space there , city officials said . The entire campus contains about 1.7 million square feet of office space , and new zoning approved about a year ago could allow total build-out of up to 3 million square feet . \u201c All things considered , there 's still quite a bit of room to put more structures out there , \u201d said Sailesh Mehra , associate city planner for the city . \u201c You could essentially double that entire office park , if you can you could park it. \u201d Google \u2014 which like many expanding tech companies is focused on reducing its car and shuttle trips as traffic worsens during the current boom \u2014 may be eyeing transit options beyond freeways . Pacific Shores is a half mile from the Port of Redwood City , where a Google pilot project earlier this year tested running ferries from San Francisco and Alameda to the port . The Water Emergency Transportation Authority , which administers the San Francisco Bay Ferry routes , has studied regular public ferry service to Redwood City , with a potential public terminal practically next door to Pacific Shores . `` I know they really liked the ferry and the concept . Their challenge was getting people off a boat and putting them on a bus to Mountain View , and that was taking 25 minutes , '' said Kevin Connolly , director of planning and development for WETA . `` This might be one way to address it . '' San Mateo County has about $ 22 million left in a sales-tax funded pot for ferry services in the county . A Redwood City terminal would cost about $ 15 million . But the county does n't have ongoing operational funding , Connolly said . A major built-in user such as Google could help make service pencil out , he said . `` If they 're serious about doing it , we could do something , and there are lots of options , '' Connolly said . `` We could be very creative about working this out . '' If the deal is completed , it would probably take several years for Google to truly put its stamp on Redwood City . Tenants are in the buildings long term , and Google \u2019 s continued expansion elsewhere in Silicon Valley \u2014 it just leased another 424,000 square feet in Sunnyvale\u2014 means it \u2019 s probably not under immediate pressure to occupy the campus . The current and future Google growth `` ( is ) going to impact the face of the Valley , '' Mark Bodie , a senior vice president with JLL who represents landlords , said on a market update call with media earlier this week , . `` It 's really going to change the dynamics of what 's available for lease .

According to a report in Iraq 's pro-government newspaper , al Sabaah , the disease was brought to Mosul by 'terrorists ' arriving 'from several countries ' and Africa . The symptoms of Ebola , which include nausea and vomiting , diarrhea , bleeding and bruising , are similar to those of other diseases including malaria and yellow fever meaning it could easily have have been misdiagnosed . In addition , very few ISIS fighters are believed to have travelled up from West Africa where the Ebola outbreak originated with most coming from areas where there have been no reports of the disease . The reports have appeared in pro-government and Kurdish media but if true it could have catastrophic implications for people in ISIS-held areas as the group is against western science and medicine .

{"claim": "Boko Haram leader denies ceasefire deal , says 200 abducted girls married off", "evidence": "MAIDUGURI , Nigeria \u2014 The leader of Boko Haram has denied agreeing to any cease-fire with the Nigerian government , and said he married off the more than 200 schoolgirls that the Islamic extremist group kidnapped . In a new video released late Friday night , Abubakar Shekau dashed hopes for a prisoner exchange to get the girls released . `` The issue of the girls is long forgotten because I have long ago married them off , '' he said , laughing . `` In this war , there is no going back . '' Nigeria 's chief of defense staff , Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh , on Oct. 17 announced that Boko Haram had agreed to an immediate cease-fire to end a 5-year-old insurgency that has killed thousands of people , and driven hundreds of thousands from their homes in northeast Nigeria . But attacks and abductions have continued , with the extremists this week seizing Mubi , a town of more than 200,000 people . Fighting also continued Friday in Vimtin , the nearby village where Badeh was born . Shekau in August announced that Boko Haram wanted to establish an Islamic caliphate , along the lines of the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq . Fleeing residents have reported that hundreds of people are being detained for infractions of the extremists ' version of strict Shariah law in several towns and villages under their control . Boko Haram 's kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls taking exams at a boarding school in the remote northeastern town of Chibok in April prompted an international campaign for their release and criticism of Nigeria 's government for not acting quickly to free them . Dozens of the girls escaped on their own in the first few days , but 219 remain missing . The hashtag # BringBackOurGirls has been used on social media sites , including Facebook and Twitter , in an effort to spark conversation about the kidnappings . Nobel Peace Prize laureate and international education activist Malala Yousafzai visited Nigeria in July , and urged Boko Haram to free the kidnapped girls , calling them her `` sisters . '' Unconfirmed reports have indicated that the girls have been broken up into several groups , and that some may have been carried across borders into Cameroon and Chad . The government had said it had negotiated with two Boko Haram leaders in Chad , with talks hosted by President Idriss Deby , and that it was confident the girls would be freed soon . But Boko Haram has many factions . Shekau 's announcement further discredits the government of Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan , who on Thursday formally announced his candidacy for elections on Feb. 14 , 2015 , in Africa 's most populous nation . Nigeria , with some 160 million people , is divided almost equally between Muslims who dominate the north and Christians in the south . The West African nation is the biggest oil producer on the continent and has its biggest economy . Jonathan 's failure to curtail the insurgency and many corruption scandals are not expected to dim his chances of success . The election , though , is expected to be the most hotly contested since his People 's Democratic Party took power after decades of military dictatorship ended in 1994 . Dozens of ruling party legislators have defected to the coalition All Progressives Congress , losing the PDP its majority in the lower house of Parliament . But the coalition is weakened by its inability to choose a presidential candidate , and primaries in December will be contested by three powerful northerners who all are Muslim . Jonathan , a Christian from a minority southern tribe , has been criticized for ignoring an unwritten party rule to alternate power between Christian and Muslim leaders , adding a religious and ethnic dimension to the election .

{"claim": "Pentagon : death of al Shabaab leader in U.S. strike would be major blow", "evidence": "Aaron Sorkin 's upcoming film about former Apple CEO Steve Jobs has reportedly found its Steve Wozniak : Seth Rogen . The news , first reported by Variety on Thursday , comes just one week after Sorkin confirmed that Christian Bale will portray Jobs in the Sony Pictures film , which is based on Walter Isaacson 's biography of the late tech luminary . Sony did not immediately respond to Mashable 's request for comment about the casting report , but Rogen is no stranger to working with Sony . He previously starred in the studio 's This Is the End last year and will star in The Interview in December . This is the seventh film Sorkin has written , including The Social Network in 2010 . It will be told in three sequences focusing on Apple 's launches of the iPod , NeXT and the Macintosh . The movie \u2014 like Open Roads ' Jobs flick starring Ashton Kutcher as as the titular character and Josh Gad as Wozniak did \u2014 will explore Jobs ' life , particularly his relationships . `` It \u2019 s not a biopic ; it \u2019 s not the story of Steve Jobs \u2014 it \u2019 s something much different than that , '' Sorkin said in April . `` He \u2019 s a fascinating guy \u2014 part hero , part antihero ... He \u2019 s a fascinating guy surrounded by fascinating people , and he had very interesting relationships with the people in his life . '' Steve Jobs passed away on Oct. 5 , 2011 . Sorkin confirmed this year that he finished the film 's script . `` It will be up to the audience whether it \u2019 s good or not , '' Sorkin said . `` But Steve Jobs is one of the very few times I ended up writing what I set out to write . It \u2019 s an incredibly satisfying feeling . '' Wozniak was critical of Gad 's portrayal ( `` personalities are very wrong although mine is closer '' ) , so it will be fascinating to see what he has to say about Rogen . Steve Jobs introduces the Macintosh to the world . Computing would never be the same . Ridley Scott 's famous `` 1984 '' commercial for the original Macintosh continues to find imitators , even today . In 2011 , Motorola attempted to spoof the classic ad in a promotional spot for its Xoom tablet . When Bill Gates appeared on-screen at Macworld Boston in 1997 , the audience reacted with boos and hisses . Still , the decision to partner with Microsoft and have Microsoft commit to producing software for the Macintosh was one of the most shrewd -- and likely one of the most intelligent -- decisions that Jobs made upon his return to Apple . Although many incorrectly believe that Microsoft `` bought '' Apple in 1997 , the reality is , without Microsoft 's investment and commitment to developing Macintosh software , the company may have had a more difficult time getting its next line of products to the market . The iMac helped set the standard for the modern Apple even as we know it today . Designed by Jonathan Ive , the iMac was sleek , modern and affordable . This was not the Macintosh of the early to mid 1990s , it was something new . With the iMac , Apple became cool . We can vividly remember looking at the egg-shaped all-in-one design with the hockey puck mouse and famous lack of a floppy drive and being transfixed . The iMac marked the beginning of Apple 2.0 . Nearly 10 years ago , Apple debuted the iPod . Famously ridiculed and dismissed by Slashdot , it would be several years before the device would become iconic , and in the process , change Apple fundamentally as a company . The premise behind the iPod was simple : 1,000 songs in your pocket . Its the execution that set the device apart from everyone else . In 2003 , Apple flipped the switch again , with the launch of the iTunes Music Store . In a post-Napster industry , most were skeptical that iTunes could drive music sales . Eight years later , iTunes is the number one music retailer by a large margin . Ten years on , the iPod is getting long in the tooth , but it still remains the leader in its product category . After the iPod started to achieve massive success in 2003 and 2004 , the rumors of an iPod phone started to swirl . The first attempt to bring a product like that to the market was in the form of Motorola 's Rokr . The Rokr tried to capitalize on the success of the Razr , while also adding compatibility with iTunes . Still , the device was a dud . You can see Steve Jobs 's frustration with the device in this demonstration . The Rokr was an example that only Apple could build an Apple product . Steve Jobs 's commencement speech at Stanford University in 2006 is one of our favorite Jobs moments . It 's riveting , inspirational and every bit as good as any Apple product keynote . All hail the Jesus Phone . The iPhone changed the mobile industry . Full stop . The mobile world and ecosystem that we know today would not exist in the same way that it does now without the iPhone . The iPhone also changed Apple as a company and helped further cement Jobs 's place in history . Steve Jobs and Bill Gates are two of the most powerful and influential men of our times . Seeing them together at D5 , just ahead of the iPhone 's U.S. launch , was amazing . In January 2010 , Apple changed the game again with the iPad . Like the iPod and iPhone , the critics dismissed it and predicted its failure . Its success has outpaced nearly every other technology product launch in history and is having a seismic impact on education , publishing , media consumption and computing in general . The PC era might not be over , but I 'm willing to bet that the computer I use every day in 10 years will have a lot more in common with the iPad than the MacBook Pro .", "label": "unrelated"}

But Apple could n't get the health-tracking features to work in the way it wanted . It found that people with hairy arms or dry skin had trouble using the health monitors . And the watch did n't work properly on people who wore it too loosely around their wrist . Other features that did n't make it into the final Apple Watch were blood-pressure and blood-oxygen-level tracking , according to The Journal . Those would have been tricky for Apple to include because providing medical advice or guidance from that data comes under the regulation of the FDA ( Food and Drug Administration ) in the US . We do know , however , that Apple secretly met with the FDA in 2013 to find out which features would come under the agency 's regulation . Apple was forced to cut the advanced health-tracking features from the Apple Watch because it simply could n't get them to work . That does n't mean that it is n't going to add them back in future versions of the device , though .

He had hoped it would be a simple procedure but was told by staff at the Toll Barn Veterinary Centre that the delicate surgery required to save his pet would cost \u00a3300 . The company boss initially turned down the treatment but changed his mind 10 minutes later and went back to give the go-ahead . Scroll down for video The pet owner , who has not been named , took his goldfish ( pictured ) to Toll Barn Veterinary Centre in North Walsham , Norfolk , and paid \u00a3300 for it to have a special operation after noticing it had become constipated Vet Faye Bethell , 29 , put anaesthetising agent into the fish 's water before using tiny instruments to remove two lumps from its body . The three-inch pet went on to make a full recovery after the 50-minute operation Vet Faye Bethell , 29 , was then tasked with carefully administering anaesthetic before using tiny instruments to remove a lump close to the fish 's backside . A second lump was removed from his dorsal fin before the fish was returned to water and handed back to his grateful owner . Ms Bethell said the three-inch fish made a full recovery after the 50-minute operation and said it would have died if it was left untreated . She said : 'I have never done a procedure like that on a goldfish , although I have done it before on more valuable fish like a carp . Vet Faye Bethell , 29 ( pictured ) , carried out the delicate \u00a3300 operation on the constipated goldfish 'The actual surgery is quite straightforward but administering the anaesthetic is quite complicated . 'The issue was the fish could n't poo and it would have eventually become toxic and it would have died . 'There was nothing special about the fish . He just liked it a lot . People love their pets - but that was an expensive little goldfish . ' The delicate procedure involved introducing a carefully-measured anaesthetising agent into the fish 's water . It was then removed from its tank and placed on a waterproof drape before anaesthetic water was put into its mouth via a tube and bubbled over its gills . Ms Bethell then used a miniature heart-rate monitor to check that the fish was properly 'under ' before using a mini scalpel to remove the lumps . She then sewed each cut with three stitches before using a special 'glue ' to cover and waterproof the fish 's scales before it was gradually re-awakened .

{"claim": "IS Fighters Seize Weapons Cache Meant for Kurds", "evidence": "Get ready for the tech press to flip out when Apple announces the retail price for the gold Apple Watch Edition model . Apple critics have always roasted the company for selling products that are more expensive than they should be , and they frequently use this as a wedge topic to criticize buyers . But the \u201c 18-karat gold \u201d Apple Watch Edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of $ 10,000 . The funny thing in this case is that Apple is perfectly right to be charging that much ! Do you disagree ? Check out my counterpoint , \u201c The Case Against the $ 10,000 Gold Apple Watch Edition \u201c Gold is Expensive Let \u2019 s start with a little backgrounder in gold . Everyone has a vague sense that gold is expensive . Even rabid Internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news . But most people don \u2019 t understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is . So this is a good place to begin the discussion . Update : My calculations were wrong ! Also , this was a bit \u201c back of the envelope. \u201d Now that it has some readership I realize I should go back and fix the calculations in the article to be more realistic\u2026 Here are the basic facts : Gold currently sells for between $ 1,200 and $ 1,300 per troy ounce and has been over $ 1,000 per troy ounce for the last five years . 18-karat gold contains 75 % pure gold , and that term is regulated by law . One ounce of 18k gold occupies about 1.8 cubic centimeters of volume since a typical 18-karat gold alloy weighs about 16.5 grams per cc . 18-karat gold currently sells for $ 29.11 per gram , $ 905 per troy ounce , or $ 480 per cc . .25 cc of 18k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and .75 cc gets you a deployant clasp . It takes a few more to build a watch case , anywhere from 1.5 to 8 cc depending on the size and thickness of the case . So the buckle is worth $ 120- $ 360 and the watch case $ 720 to $ 3800 just as raw gold . This is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than $ 6,000 ! Gold Watches are Expensive Let \u2019 s apply this to a watch case . Imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case 42 mm high by 36 mm wide by 10 mm deep . If it was solid , this would equal 15.12 cc of volume . But it \u2019 s a watch case , so you have to leave room for the movement , dial , case back , etc . So let \u2019 s just leave 5 mm of thickness all around , making a hollow rectangle . This equals 6.8 cc ( 42 x 36 x 10 \u2013 32 x 26 x 10 ) . Therefore , the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost $ 3,200 as of this writing . A simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18-karat gold would cost over $ 8,300 A simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18-karat gold would cost more than $ 3,200 Now let \u2019 s consider the same shape but just 2 mm thick . That \u2019 s 2.9 cc of gold , worth $ 1,400 . Pick your thickness and you \u2019 re still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold . How does this translate in the real world ? Let \u2019 s look at the retail price of some watches that are available in both stainless steel and 18-karat gold . This Cartier Tank MC is $ 15,000 more in 18k gold This Cartier Tank MC is $ 15,000 more in 18k gold The Cartier Tank MC measures 44 mm by 34 mm by 9.5 mm thick : $ 15,000 extra ( list ) for 18k gold Cartier Tank MC in stainless steel : $ 7,000 list , $ 5,800 street Cartier Tank MC in 18k pink gold : $ 22,000 list , $ 18,200 street The Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime measures 50.5 mm by 34.9 mm by 14 mm thick : $ 14,750 extra ( list ) for 18k gold Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in stainless steel : $ 8,550 list , $ 6,800 street Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in 18k pink gold : $ 23,300 list , $ 18,400 street This list could go on and on , but the gist is simple : 18-karat gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel . In fact , it \u2019 s pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under $ 10,000 in any size and from any manufacturer . Even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny Chopard Happy Sport Mini sells for $ 11,000 ! Most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either 14-karat or less , very slim and small , or long out of production and with outdated pricing . Then there \u2019 s the bracelet . Swap a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra $ 20,000 . Adding a gold bracelet to that Jaeger-LeCoultre bumps the price to $ 42,900 ! Certainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches , but one simply can not deny the raw material value in a gold watch case . And the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities : There are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold , and plenty of reserves , so no company , no matter how strong , can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers . Another reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against volatility . They can \u2019 t price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long . So they generally price somewhat higher than they would , even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials , labor , distribution , and profit in a watch . The Apple Watch Edition Will Cost $ 10,000 There \u2019 s a reason I picked those two watches for my comparisons : Both are similar in size and shape to the 42 mm Apple Watch . The Cartier is a little smaller and the Jaeger-LeCoultre is a little larger , but both represent a traditional watchmaker \u2019 s gold-cased square-ish offering in the space . And both cost more than $ 20,000 , with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle . And Jony Ive recently said that the historic Cartier Tank was one of his inspirations for the Apple Watch design ! Apple would be crazy to sell the Apple Watch Edition for $ 20,000 , though . That \u2019 s not going to happen . So they \u2019 re likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically . First , as we can see , the Apple Watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions . Although questionable from an esthetic standpoint , this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot . Second , Apple Watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display , sensors , and such . Third , the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum , not gold , to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions . Could it be gold plated ? No . Numerous reports state that it is a solid gold case . Although Apple has not apparently used the word , \u201c solid \u201d in their press releases , they do claim it is \u201c crafted from 18-karat gold \u201d and nowhere does it say it is plated or \u201c gold filled \u201d ( the industry term ) . There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple can not break these any more than Tiffany could . Apple says that the Apple Watch will start at $ 349 for that aluminum Sport model , and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel Apple Watch to be roughly $ 1,000 . It is reasonable to assume that the gold Edition model will sell for substantially more than this , with many suggesting $ 4,000 or $ 5,000 . But remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of gold ! Even with thin walls and a steel frame , it \u2019 s hard to see how Apple could make a solid 18-karat gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold . Gold is soft , but Apple claims that their special gold is twice as hard as \u201c standard gold \u201d . Taking that at face value , perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately , cutting the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch . This still leaves a few thousand dollars of material value in the case . The Apple Watch Edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes , a difference of about 20 % in terms of case volume . So the smaller model could sell for 20 % less still . My prediction is that the 42 mm Apple Watch Edition will retail for $ 9,999 with the 38 mm Apple Watch Edition retailing for $ 7,999 . This covers the cost of the gold case , the internals , manufacturing , sales , and profit , and yet does not leave Apple subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a too-thin or plated case . I will be shocked if the price is $ 4,999 , but I suppose it \u2019 s possible with some finagling and if that \u2019 s the smaller model . And it will not be any less than that . This is a $ 10,000 product This is a $ 10,000 product Bonus prediction : Given the very high price of the Apple Watch Edition , I predict that availability will be quite limited . Apple will likely create special store-within-a-store spaces in certain Apple Store locations for the Edition . I further expect them to open special standalone Apple Edition Boutiques to sell the Watch Edition , accessories , and perhaps other future high-end products . Update ! Needless to say , many people disagree with me . And now that @ Gruber Fireballed this post , I imagine I \u2019 ll hear from lots of them real soon ! The gist of the disagreement lies in the amount of gold needed for the watch case . I assumed it would be quite thick ( read sturdy ) and would contain upwards of 130 grams of 18k gold . Then there \u2019 s the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen grams . But @ GAK_PDX ( and others , though he was most visually eloquent ) suspects it contains much less gold . I think this number is way too low , but it \u2019 s a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow . And it puts the raw gold at about $ 849 at $ 29.11 per gram of 18k gold . Although this is admittedly much , much lower than my estimate , it still illustrates my point that the Apple Watch Edition is not going to be cheap . And I think he \u2019 s way off but time will tell who is right and who is wrong . Another argument is based on this 2006 analysis of a gold Rolex watch . Right off the bat one should point out that gold cost $ 400/oz when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well , something Apple is apparently not going to do with the Edition . That Rolex case contained 18.5 grams of gold alloy , but it \u2019 s much , much smaller than the Apple watch and it \u2019 s circular to boot ! A 34mm circle is 107mm in circumference , while the 42mm Apple Watch is 156mm in circumference . Use the magic of math to scale the Rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and we \u2019 re at 27.75 grams . But that case is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel , and the Apple Watch is pretty slab-sided . So we can probably double this safely and come out with $ 1,615 of gold in my mangled square Rolex case . So there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the gold . I can accept that . But let \u2019 s take a step back and think about the final price . Even if it contained less than $ 1,500 of gold , how much would it sell for ? Certainly not $ 2,000 or $ 3,000 . You still have to account for the cost of everything else , plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution . And profit for Apple ( and a hedge against the volatility of the price of gold ) . So we \u2019 re back at the $ 4,000- $ 5,000 estimate others have made . As Greg Koenig tweeted , and Forbes reported , \u201c If anyone thinks Apple is charging less than $ 5k for the Edition , they are smoking crack. \u201d Regardless of the total , it \u2019 s important to realize that the price of gold is in the driver \u2019 s seat when it comes to pricing the Apple Watch Edition . I \u2019 d love to be wrong , and I look forward to updating this piece . Thanks for reading !", "label": "unrelated"}

{"claim": "Missing American journalist reportedly beheaded by Islamic State", "evidence": "Bloodthirsty militants in Iraq released a horrific video on Tuesday that shows the apparent beheading of American journalist James Wright Foley \u2014 with the execution aimed at forcing President Obama to put an end to US airstrikes .

Sir Richard Branson of the Virgin brand fame was apparently behind the entire thing , offering the band an obscene amount of money just to reunite for a few dozen shows . The contract was reportedly for 35 shows in three cities : London , Berlin , and an unnamed location in New Jersey .

The contract also had an extension option to add 45 more shows in additional venues should the band agree . The other two original members of the group apparently signed on immediately , and Jason Bonham , the son of late drummer John Bonham , was set to step in for his father . Plant apparently met with conert promoters to discuss the deal , and during the meeting actually ripped the contract in two , ending any chance of a regrouping . While $ 800 million is certainly a lot of money , it \u2019 s not like Robert Plant ( or any of the other members for that matter ) really need it . Led Zeppelin are one of the most successful groups of all time , having sold around 112 million records in the United States alone ( that figure is three or four times that when the entire planet is counted ) . In fact , they are the fourth best-selling music act in American history , right behind The Beatles , Elvis Presley , and Garth Brooks . Robert Plant has also had an incredibly successful career outside of Led Zeppelin .

{"claim": "Obama , Outraged Over Beheading , Vows to Stay on Course", "evidence": "Update : Since the publication of this article , several people have reported that this may be a hoax . A 'feminist ' blog from the US has caused outrage after its author apparently admitted aborting her male fetus based on her negative past experiences of men . In an article so astounding it is difficult to believe it is actually true , 'Lana ' even expresses surprise that `` many friends , and several of my own family members have completely cut off communication with me '' . The author purports to have fallen pregnant in 2012 and was overjoyed at the thought until she discovered she was to have a boy at which point she decided to have an abortion . Read the full blog post here Abortion based on gender is illegal in the UK but just this week religious groups wrote to MPs to support an amendment to the 1967 Abortion Act to clarify the point . The amendment reads : `` Nothing in section 1 of the Abortion Act 1967 can be interpreted as allowing a pregnancy to be terminated on the grounds of the sex of the unborn child . '' The practise is said to still happen in the UK particularly in ethnic communities where boys are more valued than girls . In the blog , Lana details one of the negative experiences that was so terrible she felt she could not `` bring another monster into the world '' . The story begins aboard a plane on the way to an Occupy Wall Street rally in San Francisco . A man sat next to her upon discovering where she is going says : `` B****** like you need to learn their place . '' Lana screams `` assault '' and a male attendant rushes over but refuses to do anything as no physical contact was made . She then admits considering lying but wo n't move to one of the only two spare seats as they are `` both back in Economy '' . She adds : `` I was flabbergasted , and then betrayed as they recommended that I move to one of the empty seats . This left me in tears . `` I knew the only way to get away was to move seats so I did so tearfully and having felt as though I had been verbally and emotionally raped . '' Lana then goes on how pregnancy made her feel her body had betrayed her so much she experienced `` crying , sobbing , uncontrollable weeping , mental anguish the likes of which may only be experienced by those who have had their lives destroyed by war '' . Her decision to abort the fetus prompted furious comments . `` I almost threw up after reading this . '' `` The most disturbing part of this is what if she did n't say yes to finding out the babies gender and had the baby to realize it was a boy , what would she have had done then ? '' Fact that people abort kids in western world because of gender is thoroughly sick . `` after learning my fetus was male '' http : //t.co/YZCR0UDfBu \u2014 Caleb Bond ( @ TheCalebBond ) February 10 , 2015 Misandry means hatred of men . Feminism means equality of genders . `` Feminist Has Abortion Because Child Was a Boy '' NO . She is a misandrist \u2014 Jenni ( @ lifeofjennibeck ) February 9 , 2015 Since the backlash , Lana appears to have written another blog to defend her position where she claims to have received death threats as a result of the original post . Unfortunately she misses the point about why people would be angry at her and instead reiterates her right to choose what happens to her body . I find it hard to hate anybody , their faults are not their own , but usually rather the product of an environment or social circle they have been exposed to . I beg most of you , for your own good , take a look at yourself and decide right now if you want to spend the rest of your life angry on the internet , or if you want to fight for a woman \u2019 s right to do what she wants with her body .", "label": "unrelated"}

Asiya Ummi Abdullah denied that children are unhappy living under the oppressive rule of ISIS ' religious fanatics and explained that she felt her three-year-old son 's spiritual well-being was better served in the group 's de facto capital , where public crucifixions and beheadings are commonplace . Ummi Abduallah - who had lived in Turkey since her teens but was born in Kyrgyzstan - said moving to the militant stronghold in Syria was in part to shield the young boy from the sex , crime , drugs and alcohol she sees as rampant in her home town Istanbul . 'Who says children here are unhappy ? ... He will know God and live under his rules , ' she said . Dramatic footage has emerged from inside Kobane showing brave Kurdish fighters battling against militants from the Islamic State . The clip , which appears to have been filmed on a mobile phone , shows resistance forces from the Kurdish People 's Protection Unit ( YPG ) firing assault rifles and machine guns mounted on the back of a car at militants hiding behind buildings in the Kobane suburbs .

This morning the chilling sight of the group 's black flag could clearly be seen above buildings inside the city ; a brazen display of defiance in the face of sustained airstrikes by U.S. and Arab warplanes . While the airstrikes appear to have slowed the militants advance in some areas of the city , ISIS fighters appear to be creeping ever closer to the centre of Kobane , where thousands of civilians unable or unwilling to flee their homes face rape and massacre .

Heavily outgunned Kurdish defenders said Islamic State militants had pushed into two districts of Kobane - a mainly Kurdish border city with 40,000 residents - by late last night . Washington said the U.S. military and Arab partner nations responded to ISIS renewed assault by carrying out eight air strikes last night , adding that for now the city remains under Kurdish control .

{"claim": "Apple Watch to sell 15M units in 2015 and \u2018 ignite global smartwatch market \u2019", "evidence": "A previously unverified audio recording that allegedly captures the final moments of Michael Brown \u2019 s life has been verified as authentic , according to the video streaming application it was recorded on . A resident living in the apartment complex where Brown was killed was using a video messaging app called Glide at the time of the shooting and unwittingly captured the sound of gunfire , according to a lawyer representing the resident , whose identity has not been released . The recording suggests nearly a dozen shots were fired in an altercation between Brown , who was unarmed at the time , and Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson . According to Glide the recording was created at 12:02 p.m. CT on Saturday Aug. 9 , precisely the time police say Brown was shot . \u201c A Glide user living nearby ( whose identity is being protected ) was simply using the Glide app on their smartphone exactly as it was designed \u2013 to instantly communicate with a friend through our real-time video texting service . Simultaneously , they also captured audio in the background of the gunshots allegedly fired at Michael Brown , \u201d Glide said in a statement released on Thursday . \u201c Because Glide is the only messaging application using streaming video technology , each message is simultaneously recorded and transmitted , so the exact time can be verified to the second. \u201d The lawyer , Lopa Blumenthal , said she has shared the recording with the FBI . Federal officials won \u2019 t confirm they have this specific recording , but do confirm they are collecting any audio and video of the incident . The audio could prove to be critical piece of evidence in the ongoing investigation into Brown \u2019 s death . It also seems to confirm what some witnesses to the shooting say happened during the incident . They said Brown , who was black , and Wilson , who is white , were seen struggling through the driver \u2019 s side window of Wilson \u2019 s police car . They said Wilson fired a single shot from inside his car and then fired several more as Brown attempted to flee . Some witnesses , viewing the incident from different vantage points , have said Wilson fired several shots at Brown and that at some point the boy turned around with his hands up , at which point Wilson fired several more gunshots . The audio does not capture what happened just moments before or after the shooting . And law enforcement officials say that at this stage it \u2019 s impossible to know what the significance of this tape may be . Days before the release of the audio earlier this week , Tommy Chatman-Bey , who lives in the Canefield Green Apartment complex near where Brown was killed , told msnbc that he was outside at the time of the shooting and was an ear-witness . \u201c I was right out there when I heard it , \u201d Chatman-Bey said . \u201c I heard Boom , Boom , Boom , pause , Boom , Boom , Boom , Boom and then some more. \u201d The police have not provided many details about the shooting and have not released a detailed police incident report . What Ferguson police have released is a report with little more than the date , time and location of the incident . But more curious are the time stamps on the document . Typically an incident report following a homicide would give a detailed account . The report , released only after the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri sued under open records law , suggests a supervisor had not reviewed it until Aug. 19 , 10 days after the fatal shooting . Final sign-off wasn \u2019 t given until Aug. 20 , the report appears to indicate . Glide in their statement said , \u201c While tragedy is never good news , and our hearts go out to the family of Michael Brown , this incident underscores how technology is changing the landscape of not only journalism , but also criminology . We commend this Glide user for turning their Glide video message over to FBI investigators as possible evidence in this ongoing investigation. \u201d A key question could be why Wilson paused in the midst of the barrage . Brown was struck with at least six bullets including two that hit his skull , according to an autopsy performed at the behest of Brown \u2019 s family . Lawyers for Brown \u2019 s family have been critical of what forensic examiners identified as the two head shots that actually killed Brown . At least one of the shots struck Brown at the top of his head . Witnesses claim that as Brown fell to his knees and attempted to surrender to Wilson that the officer continued to walk toward him , firing several more shots . St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch began presenting evidence in the case to a grand jury last week and said a decision on whether or not Wilson will be charged may not come until October .", "label": "unrelated"}

{"claim": "Soldier shot in Ottawa at War Memorial", "evidence": "( Reuters ) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is in firm control of his government but has hurt his leg , a source with access to the secretive North 's leadership said on Thursday , playing down speculation over the 31-year-old 's health and grip on power . North Korea 's state media , which usually chronicles Kim 's whereabouts in great detail , has not made any mention of his activities since he attended a concert with his wife on Sept. 3 . The source said that Kim hurt his leg while inspecting military exercises . `` He ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part too . They were crawling and running and rolling around , and he pulled a tendon , '' the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity . `` He injured his ankle and knee around late August or early September while drilling because he is overweight . He limped around in the beginning but the injury worsened , '' the source said . Kim , who has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011 , had been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in July , which would imply he may have aggravated an earlier injury . Kim needs about 100 days to recuperate , said the source , whose information could not be independently verified . `` Kim Jong Un is in total control , '' said the source , who has close ties to Pyongyang and Beijing . Friday is the 69th anniversary of the founding of North Korea 's Workers ' Party , an event Kim has marked in the past two years with a post-midnight visit to the Pyongyang mausoleum where the bodies of his father and grandfather are interred . If Kim does not turn up , it could fuel speculation over the state of his health and whether he may have been sidelined in a power struggle , experts said . `` The longer he remains out of the public eye , the more uncertainty about him , and the status of his regime , will grow , '' said Curtis Melvin , a researcher at the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington . NOT KIM 'S FIRST ABSENCE North Korean officials have denied that Kim 's public absence since early September is health-related and a U.S. official following North Korea said this week there were no indications he was seriously ill or in political trouble . It remains unclear why a leg injury would keep Kim out of the public eye for so long , although this is not the first time he has been missing from public view . In June 2012 , six months after coming to power , state media failed to report on or photograph him for 23 days . He re-surfaced the next month at a dolphinarium . Speculation that Kim 's unusually long absence from public view may be due to ill health was fuelled by a North Korean TV report late last month that said he was suffering from `` discomfort '' . Some Pyongyang watchers also suggest that Kim may have been sidelined in a power struggle , a scenario they say was reinforced by the unexpected visit on Saturday of a high-level delegation to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in Incheon , South Korea . Another interpretation of that visit holds that it was meant to convey stability in Pyongyang . The source with knowledge of Kim Jong Un 's health said rumours of a coup were `` rubbish '' . `` It would have to be a very subtle coup indeed not to disrupt international travel plans , '' said Andray Abrahamian of the Choson Exchange , a Singapore-based NGO running a programme for North Koreans in Southeast Asia . North Korea is a hereditary dictatorship centred on the ruling Kim family . Kim 's sister , Kim Yo Jong , is known to have an official role within the ruling party . His brother , Kim Jong Chol , and his estranged half-brother are not in the public eye . Kim was absent from a Sept. 25 meeting of the Supreme People 's Assembly , or parliament , the first he has not attended since coming to power three years ago . However , Kim 's name has not disappeared from state propaganda . Thursday 's edition of the Workers ' Party newspaper , the Rodong Sinmun , carried three letters to Kim from overseas allies on its front page , and has reported on returning athletes from the Asian Games who thanked `` the Marshal '' for his support during the competition . Abrahamian said it was unlikely Kim had been usurped . `` Kim Jong Un has always shared power with other key figures and even if the internal balance of power has shifted , it is unlikely that they would want to remove him , given his unmatchable symbolic value . Again , though , everyone is guessing , '' he said . ( Additional reporting by James Pearson ; Editing by Mike Collett-White and Raju Gopalakrishnan )", "label": "unrelated"}
{"claim": "Was Heart-Tugging Viral Video Of Generous Homeless Man All A Hoax ?", "evidence": "Google leased all 1.9 million square feet of Moffett Place , a Sunnyvale office complex under development by Jay Paul Co. Google Inc. has cemented a pair of massive real estate deals in Sunnyvale and Redwood City that boost the company 's Silicon Valley footprint by 2.8 million square feet \u2013 about the size of the Empire State Building and enough room for more than 10,000 workers . Even by Google standards , the latest transactions are blockbusters : In one deal , Google has agreed to lease all of Jay Paul Co. 's Moffett Place , a 1.9 million square foot office campus currently under construction in Sunnyvale . It 's a contender for the largest office lease ever signed in Silicon Valley and perhaps the state of California . In a separate but no less notable deal , Mountain View-based Google completed the purchase of six buildings from Blackstone Group and Starwood Capital totaling about 934,000 square feet at Redwood City 's Pacific Shores office park . It 's Google 's first entry into that city and a potential game changer for that commercial real estate market . `` Google is obviously a very strong company and they are in hyper growth mode , '' said Amber Schiada , director of research for real estate services firm JLL . The deals \u2014 both of which I previously reported were in the works \u2014 were confirmed by sources close to the transactions . Google declined to comment for this story . Blackstone did n't return inquiries . Jay Paul 's longtime broker Phil Mahoney of Newmark Cornish & Carey , would only say that Moffett Place is off the market . Google 's expansion on the Peninsula has been the biggest real estate story since the 2008 Great Recession as the world 's biggest Web-search advertising company has bought and leased building after building , radiating out from its Mountain View headquarters . Its real estate growth dwarfs even that of Cisco Systems Inc. 's expansion during the 1990s . Terms of the latest deals were not disclosed , but sources estimated the Redwood City sale at around $ 625 per square foot , or $ 583.75 million . That would make it perhaps Google 's single largest real estate acquisition by footprint and dollar amount ever in Silicon Valley . `` I welcome them to our city and I look forward to working with them , '' said Redwood City Mayor Jeffrey Gee in an interview this afternoon . `` For a long time I would go around and say , 'Redwood City is one of the best kept secrets in the Bay Area . With Google and everything going on , we 're not a secret anymore . ' '' Aside from sheer size , the deals are notable for several reasons . First , they showcase Google 's incredibly ambitious growth plans as the company enters new business sectors such as wearable computing , self-driving cars and robotics \u2014 all of which could be huge space users on their own . Google has not even moved into much of the space it has leased or bought over the last several years . Yet the company continues to bank more elbow room for future expansion , suggesting it is thinking far down the line in terms of its space needs . Google counted 55,030 employees globally as of Sept. 30 , according to its most recent quarterly report , up 18 percent \u2014 or 8,600 Googlers \u2014 from a year ago . The transactions also alter the marketplace dynamics in two cities by taking available space off the table . Schiada noted that Moffett Place was the largest speculatively built project under construction in Silicon Valley . In Redwood City 's Pacific Shores , which is more than 90 percent leased , I 'm told Google will honor all current tenants ' leases for now , but will evaluate moving into spaces as they become available in the years ahead . `` A big question is what does this leave for tenants , '' Schiada said , speaking specifically about the Moffett Place deal . `` It also increases rates , because the supply becomes more limited . '' Still , that could actually be a good thing for tenants down the line by pushing developers to build more product , she added . `` This deal essentially eliminates a significant portion of new development , which could prompt more developers to move forward , '' she said . Jim Beeger , a veteran broker with Colliers International , said in the short term , the Sunnyvale deal could also push tenants back into the market . The transaction could `` cause tenants of all sizes to realize they should have more of a sense of urgency in their search for a new site , '' he said . `` Moffett Place will be difficult to replicate , and those who lingered no longer have this option . '' Sethena Leiker , senior analyst for Cushman & Wakefield 's Silicon Valley office , agreed . `` There 's not a lot of spec development coming , '' she said . `` If you want to take any new space , you 're going to have to take something that 's proposed . '' One result , Beeger said , could be a `` trickle-down effect '' of growing tenants moving to other areas of Santa Clara County that have available sites . Score for Sunnyvale Google 's lease at Moffett Place is a huge win for San Francisco-based Jay Paul Co. , if one that 's not entirely unexpected . Jay Paul already leased 949,000 square feet to Google in Sunnyvale at a nearby campus called Technology Corners , making Google a natural prospect for the new development . And while Google has not yet started moving into Technology Corners , the company has also been growing elsewhere in Sunnyvale this year , snapping up the old Juniper Networks headquarters ( 424,000 square feet ) and former head office of Palm Computing Inc. ( 285,000 square feet ) . And it 's rumored that a fund , CBRE Global Investors , that 's buying up land all around Sunnyvale 's Moffett Park business district is actually acting on behalf of Google . Yet landing Google was n't guaranteed when Jay Paul started building Moffett Place earlier this year on spec . Other major tech tenants were also making offers on the property , according to sources . The rent Google is paying is n't known , but Jay Paul was asking $ 3.75 per square foot on a triple-net basis , or not including utilities , taxes and fees . Redwood City action In Redwood City , Google picks a up a major chunk one of Silicon Valley 's marquee office campuses . The 10-building , 1.7-million-square-foot project was built by Jay Paul Co. in the early 2000s and gained notice for its sleek design and swanky amenities including pools , a rock-climbing wall , day spa and baseball diamonds . Starwood bought the campus in 2006 for about $ 833 million , and immediately sold two buildings to Shorenstein , the San Francisco-based landlord . Blackstone came into the picture after acquiring the junior debt on the property a couple of years ago . Informatica also acquired two buildings out of the 10 in 2012 for $ 525 per square foot . Google 's acquisition this week is only for the six Blackstone/Starwood buildings . As I reported earlier this month , a new owner could build even more office space at Pacific Shores . New zoning approved about a year ago could allow total build-out of up to 3 million square feet . Google \u2014 which like many expanding tech companies is focused on reducing its car and shuttle trips as traffic worsens during the current boom \u2014 may have been attracted to the project partly for its water transit possibilities beyond freeways . Pacific Shores is a half mile from the Port of Redwood City , where a Google pilot project earlier this year tested running ferries from San Francisco and Alameda to the port . Mayor Gee said the city would be happy to work with Google on such a plan , should the search company decide to go in that direction . `` One of the things that 's always a challenge with new forms of transportation is , is there enough there there , '' he said . `` With Google , that potentially brings the there there .

The group 's leader , Abubakar Shekau , said the girls had converted to Islam and been married off since being taken . Nigeria 's army announced a ceasefire with the militants on 17 October , saying the girls would soon be freed . But violence has continued since news of the alleged truce , including a fatal bomb blast on Friday . Boko Haram has been fighting an insurgency since 2009 , with some 2,000 civilians reportedly killed this year . 'We will not negotiate' In a video released on Friday , Abubakar Shekau said : `` We have not made ceasefire with anyone . We did not negotiate with anyone . It 's a lie . `` We will not negotiate . What is our business with negotiation ? Allah said we should not . '' Shekau also claimed that the militants were holding a German national , thought to be a teacher , who was kidnapped by gunmen in July . There was no indication of when or where the group 's latest video was shot . The BBC 's Tomi Oladipo in Lagos says the video will come as a huge embarrassment for the Nigerian government after it said it had secured a ceasefire with Boko Haram . The Islamist militants sparked global outrage in April by abducting 219 schoolgirls from the remote north-eastern town of Chibok , in Borno state . Their continued captivity has led to criticism of the Nigerian government 's efforts to secure their release . Hopes were raised earlier this month when Nigeria 's chief of defence staff , Alex Badeh , announced a truce with the group . `` They 've assured us they have the girls and they will release them , '' he said . `` I am cautiously optimistic . '' But the Boko Haram leader said the girls were `` in their marital homes '' after being married off by the group . Last week , Human Rights Watch said in a report that Boko Haram was holding more than 500 women and young girls captive and that forced marriage was common in the group 's camps .", "label": "unrelated"}

When Foley first disappeared in Syria , reports indicated that he had been captured by pro-government forces . Instead , it appears that his captors were members of ISIS .

In a [ likely ISIS-scripted ] speech , he blames Obama and the U.S. government for his impending death and implores his family not to take a penny from the government .

One person said the watch 's battery life is currently `` about a day , '' and that the company is working on modifications ahead of its launch to improve it . A one-day battery life is about on par with other touchscreen smart watches currently available on the market , including devices running the competing Android Wear platform . The uptime stands in contrast to less powerful smart watches , like the Pebble , which utilizes a monochrome black-and-white display and lacks a touchscreen . Pebble 's low-power screen is always on and provides up to a week of use before the wrist-borne device needs to be recharged . Battery life for the Apple Watch remains somewhat up in the air because the product is n't yet finalized and ready for launch . Apple revealed on Tuesday that the wearable device will launch at some time in early 2015 , but declined to offer a more specific window . The company was also vague on other aspects of the hardware , including pricing . While the Apple Watch will start at $ 349 , a breakdown of how much various models will cost was not given .

{"claim": "In Vogue vs Rats War , the Rats Are Winning", "evidence": "( CNN ) -- A company whose video chat service apparently captured audio of Michael Brown 's shooting said Thursday the recording was created at the time the Missouri teenager was killed this month . The revelation from Glide appears to bolster a man 's claim that he inadvertently recorded audio of gunfire at the time a police officer shot and killed the 18-year-old Brown in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson on August 9 . The video was created at 12:02:14 p.m. that day , Glide said . Brown , who was unarmed , was shot by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson shortly after noon . `` A Glide user living nearby was simply using the Glide app on their smartphone exactly as it was designed -- to instantly communicate with a friend through our real-time video texting service . Simultaneously , they also captured audio in the background of the gunshots allegedly fired at Michael Brown , '' the company said . The sounds could be a piece in the larger puzzle of what happened during the shooting , which spurred days of protests in the city of 21,000 . Police have said Brown was trying to grab the officer 's gun . Witnesses say the teen was holding his hands in the air when he was fatally shot . Investigators are determining whether to accuse the officer of wrongdoing ; no charges have been filed . The FBI obtained the audio and interviewed the man who made the recording , said Lopa Blumenthal , a lawyer for that individual . The man , who asked that his identity not be revealed , lives near the site of the Brown shooting and happened to be using the application at the same time Brown was shot , Blumenthal said . In the recording , a quick series of shots can be heard , followed by a pause and then another quick succession of shots . Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots -- a cluster of six , followed by four . The significance of the pause Witnesses and a friend of Wilson have given conflicting accounts of what led to Brown 's death , and the pause could be key in the investigation . But it 's difficult to prove from the audio why the pause took place or whose narrative it supports . Ferguson police have alleged that Brown robbed a convenience store shortly before the shooting , and that he and a friend , Dorian Johnson , were walking down a street when Wilson approached them in a police car . Police say Wilson stopped Brown not because of the theft , but because Brown and a friend were blocking traffic . Wilson tried to exit his vehicle but Brown pushed him back into the car , according to a preliminary investigation , St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said . Read the police reports Brown assaulted the officer while Wilson was in the car , and a shot was fired inside the police car during a struggle over the officer 's gun , Belmar said . Johnson disputes that , saying Wilson -- while sitting in the car -- started the scuffle by grabbing Brown by the neck , and that Brown tried to pull away . Johnson also said that there was no struggle for the gun , but rather that Wilson drew the weapon and shot Brown once at the car . Johnson said Wilson shot Brown again as the teen ran away . According to Johnson , Brown was struck in the back and then turned around and put his arms up as the officer kept shooting . But a woman who identified herself as a friend of Wilson called in to a St. Louis radio show with what she said was the officer 's version of events . The caller , who identified herself only as `` Josie , '' said Brown -- after going away from the vehicle following the first shot -- turned around , taunted the officer and charged at him . Her account matches what Wilson has told investigators , a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told CNN . An autopsy showed Brown had six gunshot wounds . Attorney Chris Chestnut told CNN this week he was surprised by the gap in shots . `` It 's the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting , especially with an unarmed victim , because at this point Mr. Brown is defenseless -- he has no weapon , '' said Chestnut , who represented the family of Jonathan Ferrell . Like Brown , Ferrell was an unarmed African-American man who was shot and killed by a white police officer . That incident occurred in North Carolina . But if the gunfire heard on the audio is from the Brown incident , the pause does n't automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer . `` To be fair , there could be other explanations for that pause , '' said attorney Van Jones , co-host of CNN 's `` Crossfire . '' `` Maybe the officer will say , 'Well , I fired and he kept advancing , so I fired again . ' `` Complete coverage CNN 's Holly Yan and Catherine E.

{"claim": "Islamic State training pilots to fly MiG fighter planes , says monitoring group", "evidence": "When Apple introduced its Apple Watch in September , the company said there would be three editions along with various face options and bands . Customers will literally have dozens of watch configurations to choose from . Only the base model got an official price of $ 349 , however . Now a report claims to have pricing information on other editions . MacRumors spotted a French blog whose sources suggest the stainless steel Apple Watch variant will start at $ 500 while gold models could cost $ 4,000 and up . The iGen blog has been credible in the past , correctly predicting the size of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus . If you take the view that Apple Watch is simply another smartwatch or gadget , the prices may not make that much sense . Look at the device as a fashion statement with smarts , though , and the anticipated costs sound viable . Apple has designed the watch and will market it as a modern timepiece that adds smartwatch functions to your wrist . It \u2019 s already considered a luxury brand by many and people are clearly willing to pay premium prices for that brand . The stainless steel pricing is certainly believable to me . Look at Pebble to see why . Pebble Steel fashion You can buy a plastic Pebble smartwatch for as little as $ 99 now , recently discounted from its $ 149 price . The same watch and functionality in a more aesthetically pleasing stainless steel case will cost you $ 199 , or double the plastic model \u2019 s price . It \u2019 s reasonable to assume an Apple Watch with stainless steel casing will cost $ 500 based on that . I wouldn \u2019 t be at all surprised to see that come with a leather strap , with an additional $ 50 to $ 100 cost for a matching stainless steel strap . Unfortunately , we \u2019 re not likely to know the official retail costs until this coming spring , as Apple won \u2019 t be selling the Apple Watch until then . For now , potential customers have time to save up for Apple \u2019 s timepiece \u2014 something they may need to do if they want an Apple Watch in gold .", "label": "unrelated"}

{"claim": "James Foley remembered as 'brave and tireless ' journalist", "evidence": "NEW YORK \u2014 Pope Francis has given hope to gays , unmarried couples and advocates of the Big Bang theory . Now , he has endeared himself to dog lovers , animal-rights activists and vegans . Trying to console a little boy whose dog had died , Pope Francis told him in a recent public appearance on St Peter \u2019 s Square that \u201c paradise is open to all of God \u2019 s creatures \u201d . While it is unclear whether the Pope \u2019 s remarks helped soothe the child , they were welcomed by groups such as the Humane Society and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( PETA ) . In his relatively short tenure as leader of the world \u2019 s one billion Roman Catholics since taking over from Benedict XVI , Pope Francis , 77 , has repeatedly caused a stir among conservatives in the church . He has suggested more lenient positions than his predecessor on issues such as homosexuality , single motherhood and unwed couples . Theologians cautioned that Pope Francis had spoken casually , not made a doctrinal statement . Reverend James Martin , a Jesuit priest and editor-at-large of America , a Catholic magazine , said he believed that Pope Francis was at least asserting that \u201c God loves and Christ redeems all of creation \u201d , even though conservative theologians have said paradise is not for animals . \u201c He said paradise is open to all creatures , \u201d Rev Martin said . The question of whether animals go to heaven has been debated for much of the church \u2019 s history . Pope Benedict said during a 2008 sermon that when an animal dies , it \u201c just means the end of existence on earth \u201d . Ms Christine Gutleben , senior director of the Humane Society , said Pope Francis \u2019 apparent reversal of his predecessor \u2019 s view could be enormous . \u201c If the Pope did mean that all animals go to heaven , then the implication is that animals have a soul . And if that is true , then we ought to seriously consider how we treat them because they mean something to God , \u201d she said . Ms Sarah Withrow King , director of Christian outreach and engagement at PETA , one of the most activist anti-slaughterhouse groups , said the Pope \u2019 s remarks could move Catholics away from consuming meat . But there are differing views . Mr Dave Warner , a spokesman for the National Pork Producers Council , said in an email that it \u201c certainly does not mean that slaughtering and eating animals is a sin \u201d .

{"claim": "Islamist websites claim Israeli-Canadian woman kidnapped by IS : report", "evidence": "There it was in the middle of a field , baking in the sun : a cache of grenades , rockets and guns . The trove was attached to a big black parachute and , as the camera focused in on the shipment , it seemed for a moment abandoned . Then you see the masked man , who sermonized for the occasion . An American airdrop of arms , he said , which had been intended for Kurdish fighters defending the city of Kobane , had fallen into the hands of the Islamic State . \u201c These are some of the American aid [ items ] that were dropped for the atheists in the \u201d Kurdistan Workers \u2019 Party , \u201d the militant said in a video uploaded to jihadist social media accounts and initially reported by SITE Intelligence Group . \u201c Ammunition , military equipment , additional equipment \u2014 these are some of the military weapons . The American forces dropped [ them ] \u2026 Praise be to Allah . Spoils for the mujahideen. \u201d News of the accidental airdrop , which the Associated Press corroborated and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed , brought fresh criticism to a military tactic \u2014 the air drop \u2014 officials said has become substantially more accurate in the past few decades , but is still evidently prone to screw-ups . And those screw-ups have popped up several times so far in the battle against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , underscoring the dangers of trusting the winds to carry valuable resources to their targets . In early August , the U.S. military dropped more than 7,000 gallons of water and 36,000 packaged meals onto a barren mountain near Sinjar , the hiding spot for nearly 40,000 Yazidis who fled the Islamic State under threat of genocide . Many packages reached their intended targets \u2014 the Department of Defense estimated 80 percent \u2014 but not all of them did . \u201c Iraqi officials said that much of the U.S. aid had been \u2018 useless \u2019 because it was dropped from 15,000 feet without parachutes and exploded on impact , \u201d wrote journalist Jonathan Krohn , who claimed to be the first Western journalist on the scene . The Washington Post \u2019 s Liz Sly agreed , saying the drops \u201c apparently went awry. \u201d Then NBC News reported late last month Iraqi military pilots accidentally dropped food , water and weapons to Islamic State fighters instead of to their own soldiers , who were battling to retain control of Anbar province . \u201c Some pilots , instead of dropping these supplies over the area of the Iraqi army , threw it over an area that is controlled by ISIS fighters , \u201d Hakim al-Zamili said , using another name for the Islamic State . \u201c Those soldiers were in deadly need of these supplies , but because of the wrong plans of the commanders in the Iraqi army and lack of experience of the pilots , we in a way or another helped ISIS fighters to kill our soldiers. \u201d Another general sheepishly added : \u201c Yes , that \u2019 s what had happened. \u201d The embarrassing anecdotes feed into the complicated history of the airdrop , which still carries risks despite being honed over decades with technological advancements such as GPS-guided parachutes . \u201c There \u2019 s no way you can predict who may end up with those weapons , and who is going to use them , or how they are going to use them , \u201d Greg Myre of the Middle East Institute told the Daily Sabah . \u201c That is one of the risks you have to take. \u201d It was a risk Bill Clinton was willing to take in 1993 . That was the year he ordered an airdrop of tens of thousands of humanitarian packages over eastern Bosnia , despite the \u201c military consistently arguing against involving U.S. troops in airdrops in hostile zones , given the fact that the accuracy of the drops is questionable , \u201d the Associated Press then reported . The brass turned out to be right . One major problem laid bare during that mission , military scientists later said , was what they called \u201c wind drift. \u201d \u201c The problem was identified in the late \u2019 90s , \u201d John McGinley , a scientist who researched the topic , told The Washington Post \u2019 s Holly Watt in 2008 . \u201c The terrain in Bosnia meant that instead of landing in one valley , the cargo could drift into another valley that was held by the enemy . Wind drift was causing all the problems. \u201d So research teams got to work , ultimately unveiling wind-forecast software that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said increased the drop \u2019 s accuracy by 70 percent . \u201c Inaccurate wind forecasts are the main culprit in missed targets for dropping supplies and other items from high altitudes , \u201d the report said . It almost immediately went into use in the war in Afghanistan , where far-flung military outposts were separated by stretches of roads pockmarked with insurgents and explosives . There had to be another way to get soldiers the equipment they needed , military officials thought , so they launched a massive increase in airdrops . \u201c We \u2019 ve gotten a lot more accurate over the years , \u201d Air Force Gen. Arthur Lichte told USA Today . That may true . But following this week \u2019 s alleged delivery to the Islamic State , there \u2019 s clearly still room for work .", "label": "unrelated"}

With the article was even a picture showing his face looking all solemn and the dates of his life . The article states that a groundskeeper was doing some routine maintenance on Nelson \u2019 s property and found him dead on the front lawn . He called 911 , and the police came out to the scene to reportedly find Nelson dead .

{"claim": "Accused Boston Marathon Bomber Severely Injured In Prison , May Never Walk Or Talk Again", "evidence": "KFC : Marijuana on the menu ? Not likely . A story that began circulating on Tuesday afternoon created a bit of a frenzy , but the fact is , there \u2019 s no sign KFC will really be selling marijuana in its stores . The story began at the Racket Report , where it was announced that marijuana profits were hitting such high levels that the fast food restaurant chain had decided to get in on the game . While the idea may appeal to pot lovers who think they can get the munchies and a bucket full of munchables in a single stop , there are a few problems . First and foremost , Racket Report appears to be a mostly satirical website , carrying multiple stories , such as the Fetal Ink Syndrome story , that have been debunked by fact-checking site Snopes . ( Here \u2018 s Snopes debunking the Fetal Ink Syndrome tale . ) KFC also doesn \u2019 t mention any marijuana sales on its official news page \u2014 a thing you \u2019 d think they \u2019 d mention if they were hoping to drum up sales . Another concern is banking . While marijuana shops were assured early in 2014 that they could have access to banks , many report still having difficulties . Though the original story claims that KFC \u2019 s pot sales will be cash only , in order to protect the restaurant \u2019 s funds , this would be no protection . If marijuana sales are understood to be federally illegal ( a question that is in limbo at the moment , with government officials calling on law enforcement to make pot arrests a very low priority , but laws still on the books ) then no funds collected by a facility could reasonably be protected . That is , if the government elected to seize funds illegally procured , they could still freeze bank accounts and seize the contents \u2014 even if all illegal dealings were handled in cash . This could not only be a concern for KFC , but for its parent company , YUM Brands . Notably , a KFC turned into a marijuana dispensary is a plot point in a South park episode , and there is another KFC that does indeed sell marijuana \u2014 but it \u2019 s not the fried chicken chain . Instead , it \u2019 s a shop called Kind For Cures , a California pot shop based on that same South Park episode , that assures on its website , \u201c This ain \u2019 t no chicken joint ! \u201d Calls to YUM Brands and to KFC Tuesday evening were not immediately returned , but there are no signs that KFC marijuana will be available in the bucket next to your extra crispy any time soon .

It was 20 years ago when the friend asked the two to pick up the Quarter Pounder for him while they were at the local McDonald \u2019 s , but he never showed up to eat the burger , according to 9 News on Feb. 16 .

Then that ran into months and now decades later , the Quarter Pounder is unwrapped and shared on a local news show . The two Australian buddies , Casey Dean and Eduard Nitz , were only 14 and 13 at the time they purchased the Quarter Pounder with Cheese for their friend . According to the Sidney Daily Telegraph , Dean states that he is pretty sure that this burger is the oldest burger in the world . While folk \u2019 s might store wine to age for 20 years , ground beef is not something you would eat after being left out a few hours , never mind decades . Dean and Nitz recently appeared on the TV show \u201c The Project \u201d with their antiquated McDonald \u2019 s Quarter Pounder and it didn \u2019 t look as one might expect a 20-year-old burger to look like .

The two Aussie buddies were about to take a bite of the very old burger in the name of charity , but the show \u2019 s host prompted them to put it down and skip this decades-old offering .

Going by the name Abu Obadya al-Abassi , ISIS posted a video on YouTube Wednesday announcing his death . The YouTube video has garnered over 75,000 hits as of Friday morning and depicts photos of the boy , but no tangible confirmation of his demise , according to The Jerusalem Post . `` It should be noted that there is no independent confirmation regarding the authenticity of the clip which was posted on YouTube showing the boy dressed in military fatigues and carrying weapons , '' the Post reported . Those who 've watched the clip have expressed `` disgust over the use of children in warfare , '' it continued . ISIS was formed last year from the group al-Qaida in Iraq and is led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi . They have garnered international attention for their atrocities in Northern Iraq and civil war torn Syria . Known as the `` Cub of Baghdadi , '' the 10-year-old al-Abassi was a native of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia . For its part , Saudi Arabia 's top religious official has denounced ISIS , calling them in recent statements enemies of Islam and civilization . Saudi Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul Aziz al-Sheikh issued the statement in August via the Saudi Press Agency . `` Extremist and militant ideas and terrorism which spread decay on earth , destroying human civilization , '' said al-Sheikh , `` are not in any way part of Islam , but are enemy number one of Islam , and Muslims are their first victims . '' It is believed , though unconfirmed , that both al-Abassi and his father were killed in an airstrike by the United States as fighting continues . News of the death of the Cub of Baghdadi comes as U.S. forces have launched airstrikes over the city of Kobani , which is located on the Syrian-Turkish border . `` The fight for the town situated near the Turkish frontier has become a major early test for the co-ordinated campaign aimed at degrading and destroying the terror group , '' reported Fox News . `` U.S. officials hope it could pull Turkey into the battle against the Islamic State as a means to opening up a new front , but also fear the country might stand aside and let two of its enemies , the Kurdish fighters and the Islamic State group , fight for the town .

The conventional wisdom so far has been that the Apple Watch Edition will cost $ 5,000 . Apple has only announced the price of the low-end Apple Watch Sport , which will sell for $ 349 .

However , Ebola symptoms \u2014 nausea and vomiting , diarrhea , bleeding and bruising \u2014 are also similar to those associated with a number of other diseases , including malaria , Lassa fever , yellow fever viruses and the Marburg virus . Also , most confirmed Ebola cases in this recent outbreak have originated in West Africa . Citing an unnamed source in a Mosul hospital , Iraq 's official pro-government newspaper , al Sabaah , said the disease arrived in Mosul from `` terrorists '' who came `` from several countries '' and Africa . While ISIS has recruited foreign fighters , very few of them \u2014 if any at all \u2014 are believed to have traveled from West Africa . The majority of the Islamic State 's African fighters came from Tunisia , according to a Washington Post report . Others came from Morocco , Libya , Egypt , Algeria , Sudan and Somalia \u2014 none of which reported any Ebola cases in 2014 . If the cases in Mosul turn out to be Ebola \u2014 a scenario that , at this point , seems highly unlikely \u2014 it would mark the first time the virus had been detected in an area controlled by ISIS , a group that does n't embrace science and modern medicine . Over the past few weeks , militants affiliated with ISIS have executed more than a dozen doctors in Mosul , according to Benjamin T. Decker , an intelligence analyst with the Levantine Group , a Middle East-based geopolitical risk and research consultancy . `` U.N. workers have thus far been prohibited from entering ISIS-controlled territory in both Iraq and Syria , '' Decker , who specializes in Iraq , told Mashable . `` In this context , '' he said , `` the lack of medical infrastructure , supplies and practitioners in the city suggests that the outbreak could quickly lead to further infection of both ISIS fighters and residents of Mosul .

Mufid al-Hasaynah , minister of Housing and Public Works in the Palestinian unity government , told Xinhua that Israel deliberately increases the suffering of the Gazans . `` Dozens of houses were filled with water of the Israeli dams , which were largely opened this morning towards the Gaza Strip .

Early on Sunday , rescue teams and firefighters rushed to the central area of the Gaza Strip to rescue dozens of Palestinians who were stuck in their houses after Israel opened the dams . Witnesses said that bulldozers were bringing sands to reduce the amounts of water that covered the houses in the area and that several main roads and streets were closed due to the floods . The Gaza-based Ministry of Interior said in an emailed press statement that the civil defense teams rescued 18 families after their homes were fully covered with water that came from the Israeli side .

Cicurel 's claims contradict IS claims , which made announcements on IS-affiliated websites Samoach al-Islam , al-Platform Media , and Twitter that Rosenberg had been captured . Earlier in the day , IS media sources even alleged that a video was coming soon . Considering the scale of yesterday 's IS advance , the story appeared plausible . Close friends , comrades , and supporters also voiced credible concern on Rosenberg 's Facebook page . The YPG fighters noted , through Cicurel , that Rosenberg was not in the city of Hoban at the time that IS claims she was abducted . They also called the story `` mere propaganda '' . While not a confirmation per se , Cicurel 's claims , in addition to circumstantial evidence , have made the story of Rosenberg 's capture implausible . Established Israeli sources exclusively ran the story purporting to be primary sources of reporting Rosenberg 's capture . The Haaretz Israeli News , the Times of Israel , the Jerusalem Post , and Ynet News almost immediately published similar reports , while media outside Israel have either not reported on the story or quoted the Israeli media . It is illegal for an Israeli citizen to travel to an Israeli-declared hostile state , including Iraq and Syria , for any reason including business and media reporting . Rosenberg , age 31 , has become infamous in recent months for joining YPG fighters in Kobani despite the illegality of her endeavor . In the past 24 hours , an IS advance pushed the YPG back on four fronts , including the northern side that borders Turkey . However , the YPG has mitigated many IS gains , due to US airstrikes and the arrival of Turkish forces sealing the border to the north . Despite the new information , little is still publicly known about Rosenberg 's status at this time . Pro-IS sources are still claiming that she is captured , while other sources are staying quiet .

{"claim": "Pizza delivery driver surprised with $ 2,000 tip", "evidence": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A man who scaled a White House fence this month and breached the mansion 's front door apparently rushed past a Secret Service agent inside and was stopped only after reaching the building 's East Room , a government official confirmed Monday . New details of the incident involving Omar Gonzalez , who allegedly penetrated the mansion deeper than was previously known , were first reported Monday by The Washington Post . The government official , who is not authorized to comment publicly about the incident , did not dispute the contents of the Post account . Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan , citing an ongoing investigation , declined to comment on the report . The disclosure comes as Secret Service Director Julia Pierson prepares to testify Tuesday before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee . Pierson is likely to address the Gonzalez incident , along with a shooting incident in 2011 which , according to a separate Post report , the Secret Service failed to recognize as an attack on the White House until days after discovering damage left by multiple rounds fired by a high-powered rifle . In the more recent incident , Gonzalez reportedly overpowered a Secret Service officer and ran through the main floor . An alarm box near the front entrance apparently had been muted . Gonzalez , who was armed with a knife , allegedly made it into the East Room before he was taken down by an agent . The fence-jumping incident and the delayed reporting of the White House shooting in 2011 represent the latest in a series of missteps by the elite protective service . This year , three agents were sent home from the Netherlands before a presidential trip after one of the agents was discovered intoxicated in a hotel hallway .

{"claim": "Media outlets identify 'Jihadi John '", "evidence": "The Islamic State militant known as Jihadi John has been identified as Mohammed Emwazi from West London . The IS frontman is believed to have appeared in a series of shocking videos in which hostages , including British aid worker Alan Henning , are brutally murdered The 27-year-old was named this morning by the Washington Post and it is understood he is known to British security services . The paper described him as being from a well-to-do family in West London , graduating from college with a degree in computer programming . MORE : Soldier who went to fight in Syria \u2018 is going to get a smacked bottom \u2019 MORE : Desperate plea for missing schoolgirls \u2018 heading to Syria \u2019 A friend said : \u2018 I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John . He was like a brother to me\u2026 I am sure it is him. \u2019 His friend added that he was radicalised after a planned trip to Tanzania following his graduation . British radicalisation experts said they believed the identity to be \u2018 accurate and correct \u2019 . A statement from the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation ( ICSR ) at King \u2019 s College London said : \u2018 We believe the identity and name published by the Washington Post and now in the public realm to be accurate and correct. \u2019 Dressed all in black with a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose and a holster under his left arm , \u2018 Jihadi John \u2019 reappeared in videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff , British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning , and American aid worker Peter Kassig . And last month , the militant appeared in a video with the Japanese hostages Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto , shortly before they were killed . A detailed Washington Post article claims Jihadi John is in fact Kuwaiti-born Emwazi , who it says travelled to Syria around 2012 before later joining IS , which has taken control of large swathes of the conflict-torn country , as well as territory in neighbouring Iraq . The article claims Emwazi started to radicalise after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster was brought to an abrupt end when he was detained on arrival in Dar es Salaam and deported the following day . It is claimed that he told friends he was flown to Amsterdam where an officer from MI5 accused him of trying to reach Somalia , where the militant group al-Shabab operates . According to the article , in 2009/2010 , Emwazi decided to move to Kuwait , where he told friends he had a job and marriage waiting for him \u2013 but was prevented from travelling there by UK counter-terrorism officials . Released hostages have told officials that Jihadi John was part of a team guarding Western captives at a prison in Idlib , Syria , in 2013 . He was joined by two other men with British accents , including one who was dubbed \u2018 George \u2019 . The ICSR said : \u2018 Jihadi John is not special in the sense that all the foreign fighters have tried to hide their identity by using pseudonyms or literally by masking themselves . \u2018 The fact that \u2018 Jihadi John \u2019 has been unveiled in this manner demonstrates that whatever efforts are made , the ability to mask one \u2019 s identity is limited or in fact impossible , and their true identities will eventually be revealed . \u2018 This demonstrates what we have long said about radicalisation , that it is not something driven by poverty or social deprivation . Ideology clearly plays a big role in motivating some men to participate in jihadist causes . \u2018 British fighters have clearly demonstrated that they are not in this conflict to take a back seat . They are full participants in this war , operating as suicide bombers , hostage takers , and executioners. \u2019 Scotland Yard has refused to confirm the reports . Commander Richard Walton , head of the Met \u2019 s counter terrorism command , said : \u2018 We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk . \u2018 We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation. \u2019 Downing Street declined to confirm or deny that the reported name was known to the intelligence and security services . Asked if David Cameron was concerned about Emwazi \u2019 s name being reported , a No 10 spokeswoman said : \u2018 The Prime Minister would be concerned about information being put into the public domain at any time that might jeopardise ongoing police or security investigations or the safety of British citizens . \u2018 There is an ongoing investigation .

Dan Olsen , 48 , who last played a PGA Tour event at the 2011 PGA Championship , told 730AM The Game in Lansing , Mich. , on Friday that `` I heard he 's on a month 's suspension ... it 's kind of a strong witness . It 's a credible person who is telling me this . '' [ + ] EnlargeTiger Woods Sam Greenwood/Getty Images Both the PGA Tour and Tiger Woods ' agent have emphatically denied claims that he has been suspended for a month by the Tour . Olsen , who played only one full season on the PGA Tour ( 2004 ) , said an exempt tour player told him , but he would not disclose the player and could n't say he fully believed him . He also told ESPN.com 's Michael Collins on Monday that the information he got about the suspension was not first-hand . `` It 's not testosterone , but it 's something else , '' Olsen said . `` I think when it 's all said and done , he 's gon na surpass Lance Armstrong with infamy . '' Olsen also talked about Woods using a `` cheater ball , '' referring to the Nike golf ball he plays , and that those allegations were potentially more damaging than the suspension . `` I 'll be looked at as just some crazy f -- - nobody making accusations about Tiger , '' Olsen told ESPN.com . Ty Votaw , the executive vice president of the PGA Tour , denied any of the claims brought forth by Olsen . `` There is no truth whatsoever to these claims , '' Votaw said . `` We categorically deny these allegations . '' The Tour almost never comments on disciplinary matters . Woods said on Feb. 11 that he was taking a break to deal with the issues in his game after withdrawing during the first round last month of the Farmers Insurance Open . `` Over the past year , Woods has withdrawn with an injury three times and now fallen outside of the 70 in the world . `` These claims are absolutely , unequivocally and completely false , '' said Woods ' agent , Mark Steinberg , in a statement . `` They are unsourced , unverified and completely ridiculous . The PGA Tour has confirmed that there is no truth to these claims . '' If Woods failed a test for performance drugs , the PGA Tour has said it is required to announce a suspension . And it would undoubtedly be for more than a month . If he failed a test for some sort of recreational substance , the tour 's policy is not to disclose any penalties . But if the transgression were severe , a month penalty would seem minor . `` They 're not even going to remember the women , '' Olsen said , referring to the personal scandal Woods endured in 2009 which led to a divorce from his wife . `` The women are going to take a distance second place . You 're gon na talk about him with Lance Armstrong . '' The PGA Tour began testing for performance enhancing drugs in 2008 and Woods has been randomly tested like other players . Only two players have run afoul of the drug testing guidelines and both were suspended for a year . Olsen tied for 12th at Tucson in 2004 , one of only eight cuts that he made in 31 PGA Tour starts that season .

The United States previously said that the strike inside Somalia had targeted Godane , but did not know whether he had been killed . \u201c We have confirmed that Ahmed Godane , the co-founder of al-Shabaab , has been killed , \u201d said rear admiral John Kirby , the Pentagon press secretary , describing it as a \u201c major symbolic and operational loss \u201d for the militant group , which aligned itself with al-Qaida . Al-Shabaab is fighting to topple Somalia \u2019 s western-backed government and regularly launches bombings and gun attacks against state targets and civilians . Godane \u2019 s death could now lead to an internal power struggle . On Wednesday US officials had said they were still investigating to see whether the strike on an al-Shabaab encampment had killed Godane , 37 , who reportedly trained with the Taliban in Afghanistan . At least three strikes hit a convoy of al-Shabaab vehicles in southern Somalia on Monday night , according to witnesses and a spokesman for the group who spoke later with the Associated Press . The al-Shabaab representative said that six al-Shabaab fighters had been killed in the strikes . The air raid came days after African Union ( AU ) troops and Somali government forces launched \u201c Operation Indian Ocean \u201d , a major offensive aimed at seizing key ports from al-Shabaab and cutting off one of their key sources of revenue : multi-million dollar exports of charcoal . AU forces were targeting Shabaab on several fronts , with Ugandan troops leading the offensives against the main port of Barawe , south of the capital , Mogadishu . The commander of the AU in Somalia has said the death of Godane would be a \u201c proud and happy moment for all Africa \u201d . Godane , who has a passion for poetry , seized world attention a year ago with the Westgate mall attack in Nairobi , which left at least 67 dead . He warned Kenya that it would suffer further atrocities unless it withdrew its troops from the AU force in Somalia . \u201c You can not withstand a war of attrition inside your own country , \u201d he said in an audio message posted on a website linked to al-Shabaab . \u201c So withdraw all your forces , or be prepared for an abundance of blood that will be spilt in your country. \u201d Washington has carried out a series of drone missile strikes in the past , including attacks reportedly targeting Godane , but rarely confirms this officially . Godane took over the leadership of al-Shabaab in 2008 after then chief Adan Hashi Ayro was killed by a US missile strike . Also known as Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr , Godane was al-Shabaab \u2019 s spiritual leader under whose direction the Somali militants forged an alliance with al-Qaida .

The president called ISIS a \u201c cancer \u201d in the region and accused them of having \u201c rampaged across cities and villages , killing unarmed civilians in cowardly acts of violence. \u201d He said it had committed torture and rape against innocent women and children and continued to enslave those they did not kill . \u201c No faith teaches people to massacre innocents , \u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201c No just God would stand for what they did yesterday and what they do every single day . People like this ultimately fail . They fail because the future is won by people who build and not destroy. \u201d The killing of Mr. Foley triggered a fierce response . The New York Daily News and The New York Post both used the same banner headline on their front pages : \u201c Savages. \u201d Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain released a statement saying \u201c the brutal murder of James Foley is shocking and depraved. \u201d At the United Nations , Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon issued a statement condemning ISIS for \u201c the horrific murder of journalist James Foley , an abominable crime. \u201d Mr. Ban said \u201c the perpetrators of this and other such horrific crimes must be brought to justice. \u201d The four-minute , 40-second video was posted on YouTube but the website later took it down . Titled \u201c A Message to America , \u201d it shows Mr. Foley kneeling in a desert landscape , clad in an orange jumpsuit in an apparent reference to the uniforms worn by prisoners at the American military detention camp in Guant\u00e1namo Bay , Cuba . Standing to his left is a masked ISIS fighter who begins speaking in English , with what sounds like an East London accent . Pulling out a knife , he says that Mr. Foley \u2019 s execution is in retaliation for the recent American airstrikes ordered by Mr. Obama against the extremist group in Iraq .", "label": "discuss"}

On Monday a Chechen-led group linked to the extremist group Ansar al-Deen , a sometime ally of Islamic State ( Isis ) and al-Nusra fighters , tweeted a photo of the black Ford F-250 in action near Aleppo . Since then , Mark Olberholtzer and his family near Houston have received hundreds of phone calls with questions and threats . Attempts to call the Olberholtzer family , who own Mark-1 Plumbing , reached only a recorded message or a disconnected line . On Tuesday Mark Olberholtzer told the Galveston Daily News he was mystified : \u201c How it ended up in Syria , I \u2019 ll never know. \u201d His son Jeff similarly expressed bafflement to KHOU local news : \u201c We had no intentions or idea that this would happen. \u201d \u201c To think something we would use to pull trailers , now is being used for terror \u2013 it \u2019 s crazy . Never in my life would I think something like that , \u201d the younger Olberholtzer told KHOU . The Olberholtzers sold the truck in October 2013 to a nearby Houston dealership run by AutoNation , confirmed Marc Cannon , senior vice-president of AutoNation \u2019 s corporate communications . Cannon told the Guardian that AutoNation sent the truck to the Adesa auction house in Houston . The car was sold on the auction block to a local used car dealer , though Adesa has not yet responded to requests to identify the dealer . An operator at the auction house told the Guardian the company has been bombarded by calls , and that she was surprised that neither the plumbers nor the jihadis had simply removed the logo . From the port of Houston the Olberholtzers \u2019 old F-250 likely made it to a dealership in eastern Europe , Africa or the Middle East , and within a few months changed hands several times before it finally reached a jihadist sympathizer . The truck then likely passed through Turkey \u2019 s porous border , which lies only a few hours \u2019 drive from Aleppo and the chaotic battles so far removed from south-eastern Texas . About erasing the logo , the elder Olberholtzer told the Galveston Daily News that AutoNation or one of the other middlemen \u201c were supposed to have done it and it looks like they didn \u2019 t do it \u201d . The plumber of 32 years said his family has received death threats and that some of the callers \u201c are really ugly \u201d . \u201c We have a secretary here , she \u2019 s scared to death . We all have families , \u201d his son told KHOU . \u201c We have nothing to do with terror at all. \u201d His father had a message to the broader world : \u201c I just want it to go away , to tell you the truth. \u201d A representative of Mark-1 Plumbing told CBS News that they plan to pursue legal action to force Twitter to remove the photo . The person said that sold vehicles would \u201c most definitely \u201d have the logo removed henceforth . Auction houses , which make more profit the faster they turn products , usually sell used cars quickly , and exporters are often keen to pick up unwanted vehicles from lots .

Photo : AFP Her capture and detention could prove to be a significant setback for Baghdadi as she may be used as leverage to negotiate the release of the many prisoners \u2013 both foreign , Iraqi and Syrian \u2013 that the Islamic State is holding . Lebanese security officials also hope her capture could be the breakthrough needed to secure the release of at least 26 Lebanese soldiers kidnapped by IS and Nusra Front militants in August . A DNA test had confirmed the child , believed to be nine years old , is Baghdadi 's son , the Lebanese al-Safir newspaper said , citing security officials . It is believed Baghdadi 's DNA may have been taken by US officials during the nine months he was held in an American-run prison in Iraq in 2004 after his capture in Fallujah However in a sign of the confusion surrounding the arrests , some media sources reported the child in custody was a girl . Dulaimi was one of 140 women released from a Syrian government jail in March this year as part of a prisoner swap that led to the release of 13 Greek Orthodox nuns held by al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front in the Syrian town of Maaloula . Since her release she is believed to have moved around the border area between Lebanon and Syria , sticking mostly to the mountainous territory held by the Nusra Front , said Mario Abou Zeid , a research analyst with the Carnegie Middle East Centre in Beirut . `` She was infiltrating the Lebanese borders , moving inside and outside Lebanon with fake IDs \u2026 in the area controlled by Nusra Front , '' Mr Abou Zeid said . `` She maintained a very low profile , protecting herself and her son . '' He warned that Dulaimi 's capture , while an important step , may be of limited value to intelligence services given the Islamic State was renowned for ensuring operational matters were never discussed outside a very tight inner circle . `` The main pillar of their success is to minimise the amount of information anyone can have access to . `` Some may think she has all the secrets of Baghdadi , even though she was captured in the Syrian regime and since her release she has been almost completely cut off from Baghdadi , on the run along the Lebanese-Syrian border . '' It is possible Dulaimi had been away from Baghdadi for so long that her information may be of little worth and her decision to relocate to Lebanon `` could have been a defection from Baghdadi , she could have been fleeing '' , Mr Abou Zeid told Fairfax Media . She is being questioned by investigators at the headquarters of the Lebanese defence ministry in the Yarze district , north of Beirut , the unnamed official said . There is no doubt the counter-terrorism operation , which involved both Lebanese , US and European intelligence agencies , will prove useful , said retired Lebanese general and security analyst , Elias Farhat . `` She is one of the wives of the so-called caliph of the Islamic State \u2026 she will be useful in the negotiations between the Lebanese authorities as IS and Jabhat al-Nusra in relation to the kidnapped soldiers , '' General Farhat said . `` Her capture is one of the successful outcomes of cooperation between Lebanese and Western intelligence agencies . '' But even as news of Dulaimi 's capture broke over Lebanon , local media reported late on Tuesday that militants had attacked a Lebanese army patrol in Ras Baalbek , with a four-man unit feared harmed or kidnapped . It is believed Baghdadi became head of the Islamic State of Iraq , a predecessor to IS , in 2010 . It then expanded into Syria in 2013 and in June Islamic State militants took control of Iraq 's second city of Mosul before moving south towards the capital . There were reports last month that he had been killed in US-led airstrikes in Iraq , although soon after the Islamic State released a recording on November 13 \u2013 purportedly by Baghdadi \u2013 in which he called for `` volcanos of jihad '' to be unleashed over the world . The US Government has offered a $ US10 million ( $ 11.84 million ) reward for his capture .", "label": "unrelated"}

Nikolai Kryaglyachenko , 12 , was blasted across the pavement when he leant briefly against a lamppost that was live from a faulty wire . `` When I came round I felt groggy but managed to get home and told my mum what had happened , '' he said . `` When I woke up the next day and got out of bed I found some coins that had been lying on the mattress had stuck to my body . `` Then when I was having breakfast and dropped my spoon , it stuck to my chest . '' Europics 'Superpowers ' : Nikolai Kryaglyachenko wants to be a superhero when he grows up Nikolai said he was a keen fan of comics and , believing that maybe he had developed some sort of super magnetic power to attract metal like Magneto , had decided to put it to the test . `` I can do things I could n't do before but I do n't have a lot of control over it , '' he said . `` Even when I do not want to do it , I still attract things . `` Once I even attracted a glass - it just moved towards me .

{"claim": "Is the iPhone 6 Really Pulling Out Your Hair ?", "evidence": "( CNN ) -- The mystery surrounding North Korea 's erratic young leader , Kim Jong Un , only deepens by the day . He has not been seen publicly in more than a month . Rumors are flying that Kim is ill with gout , diabetes , even possible problems with his ankles . Now , a group of defectors say they believe Kim 's younger sister , Kim Yo Jong , may be running the country while he recuperates . The North Korea Intellectuals ' Solidarity , a think-tank run by defectors , says Kim Yo Jong may be at least temporarily leading the government . The group has not revealed the source of its information , and CNN can not independently confirm it . But Kim Yo Jong 's star appears to be rising . Why has North Korea decided to talk now ? Michael Madden , who runs the blog North Korea Leadership Watch , says Kim Yo Jong has been identified in North Korean media as deputy director of the Workers ' Party , a very powerful position . Victor Cha , an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies who previously handled the North Korea account with the National Security Council , says Kim Yo Jong began surfacing publicly earlier this year at party functions . `` Clearly it 's an effort to slow-track her into becoming somebody who is important within the system , '' Cha says . `` I can see how it 's possible that she 's in some sort of temporary position . It 's very difficult for the North Korean system to run without one of the Kim family at least titularly in charge . So , if Kim Jong Un is indisposed , she 's really the only available body that 's left , in terms of a direct Kim family line . '' Is Kim Jong Un still in charge of North Korea ? Who is Kim Yo Jong ? Madden says Kim Yo Jong was born in 1987 or 1988 , and attended private school in Switzerland with Kim Jong Un . They both stayed at the North Korean embassy while attending the Swiss school , Madden says , and lived there under assumed names . Madden says Kim Yo Jong is the youngest of seven siblings their father , Kim Jong Il , had with four women . Many of them are half-siblings , but Kim Jong Un and Kim Yo Jong have the same mother . Opinion : Why Kim is probably still in charge Madden says Kim Yo Jong was always close to her father , and after returning from Switzerland , she was appointed to positions of responsibility in the government . She would act as an advance-team leader , inspecting sites before official visits , and had administrative duties as well . Now , he says , she continues those duties and has taken on more responsibility under her brother 's rule : dealing with policy and receiving intelligence briefings . She acts `` almost like a White House chief-of-staff would , '' Madden says . He says he believes she had a large role in planning the recent trip by three top North Korean officials to South Korea while her brother was absent from the scene . Opinion : Why Kim is probably still in charge Ready for prime time ? Given her age and that so little is known about Kim Yo Jong , North Korea-watchers are concerned about her being in the top leadership spot , if only temporarily . The stress and palace intrigue inside the North Korean regime , they say , may be overwhelming . `` If in fact she is running the country -- as someone in their early to mid twenties , to me that is quite alarming , '' Cha says . `` It means there is something seriously wrong with Kim Jong Un and there is some sort of void that they 're desperately trying to fill . '' All eyes will be on a significant event this Friday , October 10 . That 's the 69th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers ' Party . Kim Jong Un attended the anniversary event last year . If he does n't show up at Friday 's ceremonies , concern over his public disappearance will only grow . If he does attend , intelligence analysts will be looking at his appearance , his body language -- every detail -- very carefully .

{"claim": "ISIS Reportedly Beheads American Photojournalist in Iraq", "evidence": "In a horrifying act of revenge for U.S. airstrikes in northern Iraq , militants with the Islamic State extremist group have beheaded American journalist James Foley \u2014 and are threatening to kill another hostage , U.S. officials say . The White House must now weigh the risks of adopting an aggressive policy to destroy the Islamic State against resisting any action that could result in the death of another American . It will also confront the potentially necessary step of pursuing the Islamic State in Syria , where President Barack Obama has resisted launching airstrikes or deploying significant American firepower . Obama was expected to make a statement Wednesday about Foley 's killing . U.S. officials confirmed a grisly video released Tuesday showing Islamic State militants beheading Foley . Separately , Foley 's family confirmed his death in a statement posted on a Facebook page that was created to rally support for his release , saying they `` have never been prouder of him . '' `` He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people , '' said the statement , which was attributed to Foley 's mother , Diane Foley . She implored the militants to spare the lives of other hostages . `` Like Jim , they are innocents . They have no control over American government policy in Iraq , Syria or anywhere in the world . '' Foley , 40 , from Rochester , New Hampshire , went missing in northern Syria in November 2012 while freelancing for Agence France-Presse and the Boston-based media company GlobalPost . The car he was riding in was stopped by four militants in a contested battle zone that both Sunni rebel fighters and government forces were trying to control . He had not been heard from since . The beheading marks the first time the Islamic State has killed an American citizen since the Syrian conflict broke out in March 2011 , upping the stakes in an increasingly chaotic and multilayered war . The killing is likely to complicate U.S. involvement in Iraq and the Obama administration 's efforts to contain the group as it expands in both Iraq and Syria . The group is the heir apparent of the militancy known as al-Qaida in Iraq , which beheaded many of its victims , including American businessman Nicholas Berg in 2004 . The video released on websites Tuesday appears to show the increasing sophistication of the Islamic State group 's media unit and begins with scenes of Obama explaining his decision to order airstrikes . It then cuts to a balding man in an orange jumpsuit kneeling in the desert , next to a black-clad militant with a knife to his throat . Foley 's name appears in both English and Arabic graphics on screen . After the captive speaks , the masked man is shown apparently beginning to cut at his neck ; the video fades to black before the beheading is completed . The next shot appears to show the captive lying dead on the ground , his head on his body . The video appears to have been shot in an arid area ; there is no vegetation to be seen and the horizon is in the distance where the sand meets the gray-blue sky . At the end of the video , a militant shows a second man , who was identified as another American journalist , Steven Sotloff , and warns that he could be the next captive killed . Sotloff was kidnapped near the Syrian-Turkish border in August 2013 ; he had freelanced for Time , the National Interest and MediaLine . One U.S. official said the video appeared to be authentic , and two other U.S. officials said the victim was Foley . All three officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the killing by name . Several senior U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the situation said the Islamic State very recently threatened to kill Foley to avenge the crushing airstrikes over the past two weeks against militants advancing on Mount Sinjar , the Mosul dam and the Kurdish capital of Irbil . Both areas are in northern Iraq , which has become a key front for the Islamic State as its fighters travel to and from Syria . Since Aug. 8 , the U.S. military has struck at least 70 Islamic State targets \u2014 including security checkpoints , vehicles and weapons caches . It 's not clear how many militants have been killed in the strikes , although it 's likely that some were . The Islamic State militant group is so ruthless in its attacks against all people they consider heretics or infidels that it has been disowned by al-Qaida 's leaders . In seeking to impose its harsh interpretation of Islamic law in the lands it is trying to control , the extremists have slain soldiers and civilians alike in horrifying ways \u2014 including mounting the decapitated heads of some of its victims on spikes . The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists estimated Tuesday that about 20 journalists are missing in Syria , and has not released their nationalities . In its annual report in November , the committee concluded that the missing journalists were either being held and threatened with death by extremists , or taken captive by gangs seeking ransom . The group 's report described the widespread seizure of journalists as unprecedented and largely unreported by news organizations in the hope that keeping the kidnappings out of public view may help in the captives ' release . ___ Associated Press writers Bradley Klapper and Julie Pace in Washington , Rik Stevens in Rochester , New Hampshire , and Zeina Karam in Beirut contributed to this report .", "label": "discuss"}

Various witnesses have credited Vickers with leading the security response and killing the infiltrator , a man who may have been the same cold-blooded murderer who gunned down an unarmed solider outside the national cenotaph moments before .

In an RCMP career spanning 29 years , Vickers rose up the ranks from a constable in the Northwest Territories to serving ten years in Alberta , and then to chief superintendent in Ottawa . After retiring from the force , he took the Sergeant-At-Arms job on Parliament Hill , and was once famously photographed escorting a protestor masquerading as a page from the House of Commons .

{"claim": "ESPN to save NFL 's image with all-male domestic abuse discussion", "evidence": "A Guantanamo Bay prisoner released last year as part of an exchange for captured US serviceman Bowe Bergdahl has resumed contact with the Taliban , according to reports . The former detainee - one of five men released in a controversial deal which saw the return of the US PoW from Afghanistan - is said to have been in touch with members of the al-Qaeda linked Haqqani network . This is the first suggestion that any of the detainees involved in the swap may be trying to engage again in militant activity . The five , who mostly held mid- to high-level positions within the Taliban before their capture during the early days of the US-led war in Afghanistan , were detained because of their association with the terror group . Since their release they have been living in Qatar , which promised to monitor the men on behalf of the US . The Pentagon said Thursday that it is working with Qatar and is confident that any threat posed by the former detainees can be mitigated . US Sen Lindsey Graham , who recently visited Qatar , said he had been afraid that one of the detainees had left the country , but said he was assured during his visit that all five remain in the small Gulf nation . Qatar gained public praise from President Barack Obama for brokering the controversial deal in May 2014 that freed Army Sgt . Bergdahl from Taliban captivity in exchange for the release of the five senior Taliban officials who had been imprisoned for years at the US-run Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba . Qatar promised Mr Obama it would keep the five under watch for one year , although they would then be free to leave . `` It 's just a year deal , '' Mr Graham told The Associated Press on Wednesday . `` Just as sure as we 're sitting here , they 're going back to the fight . '' `` They 've had some Haqqani people come to meet with them . ... They 're reaching out . The Taliban five are communicating with people inside Afghanistan . '' However , Mr Graham , a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a leading Capitol Hill voice on foreign policy , said all five are still in Qatar . `` I was afraid one had left , but they told me they 're all still there , '' he said . The Pentagon said in a statement that it would not comment on specific cases involving the detainees . `` However , we take any incidence of re-engagement very seriously , and we work in close coordination through military , intelligence , law enforcement and diplomatic channels to mitigate re-engagement and to take follow-on action when necessary , '' the statement said . `` The Defense Department has a close security partnership with the government of Qatar . We 're confident in our ability to continue to mitigate any threat that may be posed by the former Guantanamo detainees . '' Haqqani operates in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region and has been one of the deadliest threats to US troops in the war .

{"claim": "Questions raised over Nicaragua 'meteorite '", "evidence": "A blast that filled Nicaragua 's 1.2 million capital Managua with dismay on Sunday night is most probably a meteorite that left a 12-meter crater near the city \u2019 s airport . The space rock might be a fragment of a larger space object that passed near Earth . \u201c We are convinced that this was a meteorite . We have seen the impact from the crater , \u201d Wilfredo Strauss of the Seismic Institute said , as cited by the AFP . Nicaraguan authorities are pretty sure it was a piece of an asteroid dubbed \u201c 2014 RC \u201d , an estimated 20-meter large piece of rock that whizzed close past Earth , Humberto Garcia , of the Astronomy Center at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua , told The Associated Press on Sunday . It was most clearly witnessed in the skies above New Zealand . At its closest , asteroid 2014 RC was a mere 34,000km from the Earth \u2019 s surface , about one-tenth of the distance to the moon . Experts outside of Nicaragua , however , are n't so sure that the blast came from a meteorite . So far , not a single person has come forward claiming to have seen the object fly through the sky . Considering the size of the impact crater ( about 39 feet ) , it should have also produced what the Associated Press termed \u201c a ball of flame \u201d that would \u2019 ve been easily seen by many people . In a statement on Monday , NASA said it \u2019 s possible that a meteorite caused the crater , but the American space agency also expressed doubt . `` For something to produce a hole in the ground that big , it would have generated a very bright fireball . And nothing was reported ... despite the population , '' NASA \u2019 s Bill Cooke said . `` So I 'm very skeptical . '' Whatever the object was , its impact was severe and was heard throughout Managua . The meteorite crashed into a wooded area close to Managua \u2019 s Augusto C. Sandino International Airport around midnight and left a remarkable 12-meter diameter crater , 5 meters deep . However , no one was hurt and operations at the airport were n't interrupted . Handout picture released by the Nicaraguan presidency press office showing a Nicaraguan soldier checking the site where an alleged meteorite struck on September 7 , 2014 in Managua . ( AFP Photo ) The Seismic Institute registered two shock waves after the impact , the first one seismic , and the second stronger one \u2013 from the impact of the sound . The locals living not far from the crater told media they heard an explosion , followed by sand and dust blowing through the air , accompanied by a burning smell . \u201c I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing , then all of a sudden I heard a big blast . We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave , \u201d Jorge Santamaria told AP . Nicaraguan authorities expect citizens to soon share photos and videos of the phenomenon , if they have any . When the most spectacular meteorite of recent years exploded in the sky over the Urals city of Chelyabinsk last year , with the strength of 40 Hiroshima bombs , temporarily blinding and deafening thousands of people , a large number of video clips from dashcams and webcams helped RT make a video that became one of the most acclaimed in 2013 on YouTube . The crash site near Managua was cordoned off and according to photos , Nicaraguan soldiers searched the crater with metal detectors to be sure the object was not manmade . Later on government officials and experts visited the impact site .

'There 's been a marked increase in the number of elite officials visiting the ward , ' said the source , whose comments were supported by an intelligence official in Seoul who said Kim 's official car did not appear to have left Pyongyang in recent weeks . Obese Kim is believed to have sprained then fractured his ankles during a gruelling tour of military bases and factories in shoes with Cuban heels to give him a little more height and a physical appearance of more authority .

His weight has increased since he took power in the Stalinist nation The 31-year-old North Korean leader got a taste for Swiss cheese while a student in Switzerland - and is understood to love it so much that he imports vast quantities , despite Western sanctions . 'He has become noticeably overweight since he came to power , ' said the un-named intelligence official . In a clip from North Korea 's Central TV , shown recently , Kim was seen limping when he visited a government establishment , but the date of he appointment was not known . There have been earlier suggestions that Kim 's obesity and binge drinking have brought on gout which confined him to his residence for several days . His aides , however , were determined to turn his health problems to good advantage , the official Rodong Sinmun daily newspaper reporting that he had 'laboured on ' by visiting various facilities , braving the hot summer weather . An Antonov An-2 The North Korean military has turned its ageing fleet of Soviet-era aircraft into low-tech stealth bombers using wood and fabric . Troops have stripped the metal parts off Antonov An-2 biplanes and replaced them with wooden propellers and a cloth fuselage - similar to the early warplanes of the First World War . The lighter materials mean the aircraft , first produced in 1947 and mainly used as light transports and crop dusters , less likely to be picked up on radar . It is thought the \u00a318,500 planes would be used as bombers should war break out with mortal enemy South Korea . North Korea ' air fleet , though large , spends most of its time grounded thanks to shortages of spare parts and a crippling lack of fuel .

The official Rodong Sinmun daily newspaper reported that he had 'laboured on ' despite his health problems Added to the belief that Kim was still in hospital after having operations on his ankles was the fact that he had missed a regular session of the Supreme People 's Assembly in Pyongyang last Thursday . According to a Seoul government official who spoke to the Chosun Ilbo it was unlikely 'that a young man like Kim Jong-un would have missed the Supreme People 's Assembly just because he has gout . ' His absence from the assembly was followed by a rare admission by State TV which not only showed footage of him limping but also stated that he was ill. Kim Jong-un accompanied by his wife Ri Sol-Ju during a visit to a sub unit of the Korean People 's Army Unit 552 It has also been reported that a team of doctors from Europe went to North Korea recently , leading to suspicion that would have flown half way across the world only to treat someone in high authority . A political observer in Seoul said the only real way Kim was going to return to health , beat his gout , lose weight and prevent a repeat of his reported fractured ankles was to live a more simple life 'coming down closer to the level of his people . ' Malnutrition is widespread in North Korea and famines often break out in the country , which is still reliant on foreign food aid as a result of economic mismanagement and the loss of Soviet support in the 1990s .", "label": "unrelated"}

Earlier this week al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) issued a video with a message aimed at the US government threatening to kill the hostage if its demands were not met . Last week the U.S. said it had attempted a rescue operation to free a number of hostages , including Mr Somers , but that he had not been at the site of the raid . The family of Mr Somers had earlier pleaded for him to be released . In an online video Miss Somers described her older brother as a romantic who 'always believes the best in people . ' She added : 'Please let him live . ' British-born U.S. photojournalist Luke Somers ( pictured ) , who was being held by al-Qaida militants in Yemen , has been killed in a failed rescue attempt , his sister has revealed today Luke Somers was kidnapped in September 2013 from Yemen 's capital Sana'a ( shown in the map above ) Mr Somers moved from London to Sana'a , Yemen in 2011 to become a teacher , but soon started taking pictures of public demonstrations and established himself as a photojournalist working for the Yemen Times His father Michael said Mr Somers was 'a good friend of Yemen and the Yemeni people ' . It came after the release of the AQAP video which begins with a reading in Arabic from Nasser bin Ali al Ansi , an AQAP official , before Mr Somers appears and gives a statement in English . He said : 'My name is Luke Somers . I 'm 33 years old . I was born in England , but I carry American citizenship and have lived in America for most of my life . 'It 's now been well over a year since I 've been kidnapped in Sana'a . Basically , I 'm looking for any help that can get me out of this situation . I 'm certain that my life is in danger . 'So as I sit here now , I ask if anything can be done , please let it be done . Thank you very much . ' Al Ansi gave the US government three days to meet the demands or 'otherwise , the American hostage held by us will meet his inevitable fate ' . The three-minute video also features Ansi speaking about American activity in Afghanistan , Somalia and Iraq as well as recent air strikes in Syria . It follows similar videos by another extremist militant group , Islamic State ( IS ) , which has already killed two British hostages and three American hostages in videos released on social media . Militants released a video on Thursday that showed Mr Somers , threatening to kill him in three days if the United States did not meet the group 's demands Nasser bin Ali al Ansi , senior official in Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , pictured , spoke for two minutes and thirty seconds during the video where he threatened to kill Mr Somers within three days IS has posted a series of videos online showing the separate murders of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff , US aid worker Peter Kassig and two British aid workers , David Haines and Alan Henning . Footage claiming to show Mr Henning 's murder appeared on the internet just days after the UK joined US-led air strikes against the terrorists in Iraq . The news of the failed rescue comes after a suspected U.S. drone strike in Yemen killed nine alleged al-Qaida militants early Saturday , a security official said . The drone struck at dawn in Yemen 's southern Shabwa province , hitting a suspected militant hideout , the official said . The official did not elaborate and spoke on condition of anonymity as he was n't authorised to brief journalists . At least six suspected militants were killed in an airstrike in the same province last month . Later Saturday , tribal leaders said they saw helicopters flying over an area called Wadi Abdan in Shabwa province . American authorities rarely discuss their drone strike campaign in Yemen . The strikes are incredibly unpopular in Yemen due to civilian casualties , legitimising for many the attacks on American interests .

Kirby did not elaborate on the joint U.S-Yemeni operation to free Mr Somers , saying details remained classified . However , officials have said the raid targeted a remote al-Qaida safe haven in a desert region near the Saudi border . Eight captives - including Yemenis , a Saudi and an Ethiopian - were freed . Mr Somers , a Briton and four others had been moved days earlier . Mr Somers was kidnapped in September 2013 as he left a supermarket in the Yemeni capital , Sana'a , said Fakhri al-Arashi , chief editor of the National Yemen , where Mr Somers worked as a copy editor and a freelance photographer during the 2011 uprising in Yemen .

I ain \u2019 t got normal feelings. \u201d The Associated Press update : Obama again faces tug of military action in Syria WASHINGTON ( AP ) \u2014 For three years , President Barack Obama has resisted the pull of potential U.S. military action in Syria . He has held firm even as the civil war \u2019 s death toll climbed toward 200,000 , the Syrian government used chemical weapons against civilians and Islamic State militants strengthened amid the chaos . Now Obama must decide whether the extremist group \u2019 s murder of American journalist James Foley , as well as the broader threat the group could pose to U.S. interests , should change his cautious calculus . Pressure is coming from his own military leaders to go after the Islamic State inside Syria . But he must weigh that against his aversion to the risks that could come with plunging the United States into a country torn apart by an intractable internal conflict . White House officials have suggested that airstrikes in Syria are an option , though the officials say specific military proposals has not yet been presented to the president . \u201c We \u2019 re actively considering what \u2019 s going to be necessary to deal with that threat , and we \u2019 re not going to be restricted by borders , \u201d said Ben Rhodes , Obama \u2019 s deputy national security adviser . \u201c We \u2019 ve shown time and again that if there \u2019 s a counterterrorism threat , we \u2019 ll take direct action against that threat , if necessary. \u201d Even before Foley \u2019 s murder , Obama found himself on far different footing in the Middle East than he probably expected in the sixth year of his presidency . After running for the White House on a pledge to end the Iraq war and then making good on that promise in late 2011 , Obama thrust the U.S. military back into Iraq this month with a limited airstrike campaign against Islamic State targets . Obama has said he will not send U.S. combat troops to another ground war in the Mideast . But expanding the airstrikes in Iraq and broadening them to include Syria could mean a lengthy American military commitment in the region that could consume much of Obama \u2019 s remaining time in office . \u201c What we should have learned over the past dozen years in that part of the world is that the use of military power is very unpredictable , \u201d said Stephen Walt , a professor of international affairs at Harvard \u2019 s John F. Kennedy School of Government . That may be particularly true in Syria , where President Bashar Assad \u2019 s government is warring with opposition forces . Unlike in Iraq , the battle lines are more clearly drawn . Syria has a host of military players in close proximity to each other , including the Islamic State , the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front , mainstream Western-backed rebels and pro-government forces . The Islamic State is among the groups fighting Assad , meaning a U.S. campaign to weaken the extremists could actually strengthen a leader the White House has sought to push from office . Obama could try to counteract that uncomfortable dynamic by also taking strikes against Assad , though that could put the U.S. on the hook for the kind of long-term commitment to rebuilding Syria that he has tried to avoid . The risks are no less troubling if Obama allows the Islamic State to continue having unfettered access to a safe haven in Syria . Politically , it could bolster the argument from his critics that he is overseeing an American retreat on the world stage . It also could give the militants space to strengthen and become a threat not just to U.S. interests in the region , but also to the U.S. at home . Obama \u2019 s own military leadership made clear in recent days that the threat from the Islamic State can not be fully eliminated without going after the group in Syria , as well as Iraq . \u201c This is an organization that has an apocalyptic , end-of-days strategic vision and which will eventually have to be defeated , \u201d said Army Gen. Martin Dempsey , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . \u201c Can they be defeated without addressing that part of their organization which resides in Syria ? The answer is no . That will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a nonexistent border. \u201d To White House critics , the unappetizing options are the result of Obama \u2019 s own foreign policy missteps . They argue that he gave extremists an opening in Iraq by not doing more to reach an agreement with the Iraqi government to leave U.S. forces in the country after 2011 . They say his decision to not provide heavy weaponry to more moderate rebel groups in Syria also helped facilitate the Islamic State \u2019 s rise . Without a course correction , Obama \u2019 s critics argue , the U.S. will be at greater risk . \u201c If we do not do more to assist our Iraqi partners and those moderate Syrians who are fighting ISIL and directly target ISIL \u2019 s leadership and networks in Iraq and Syria , I fear that James Foley will not be the only American to die at their hands , \u201d said Sen. Marco Rubio , R-Fla. , using one of the acronyms for the Islamic State . Obama \u2019 s advisers say the responsibility for stemming the rise of the Islamic State does not rest solely with the United States . The White House has been imploring Sunni states in the region \u2014 Saudi Arabia , Jordan and the United Arab Emirates in particular \u2014 to wield their influence with tribal leaders in Iraq and get them to push the Islamic State out of areas they have occupied . The U.S. also has been discussing ways that allies such as Britain , France , Australia and Canada can become involved through intelligence sharing , military assistance for Kurdish forces in Iraq and moderate opposition forces in Syria , and if necessary , joining the U.S. in military action .", "label": "unrelated"}

Here 's how his post starts : On Monday night , a panel on a two-hour pregame show for Monday Night Football will , among other things , address domestic abuse . This panel will discuss , once again , the appropriate penalty for hitting a woman . The panel for that discussion will include the following people : Chris Berman , Cris Carter , Mike Ditka , Adam Schefter , Tom Jackson , Keyshawn Johnson , Jon Gruden , Mike Tirico , Stuart Scott , Steve Young and Ray Lewis . Up to 11 men , all between the ages of 39 and 74 will sit at the table for a domestic violence discussion on ESPN . Zero women .

When the show has updates from the field\u2014brief reports about injuries and the upcoming game\u2014they 'll cut to female sideline reporters , Lisa Salters and , on some weeks , Suzy Kolber . These people are not allowed at the table . Collins 's outrage at ESPN 's failure to include any women in a discussion dedicated to domestic violence was shared by many , and word of the `` panel discussion '' began to spread across Twitter : And then there were a lot of other blogposts , piggybacking off of Collins 's , with headlines like these : ESPN Does n't Get It : They Ignore Women 's Voices In Public Dialog About Domestic Violence ESPN 's Domestic Violence Panel Is Missing Something Important 11 Men and 0 Women on Tonight 's ESPN Domestic Violence Panel ESPN 's Domestic Abuse Tonight Panel Will Be 100 % Dudes ESPN to save NFL 's image with all-male domestic abuse discussion And then feminist organization UltraViolet blasted this press release to various media outlets : UltraViolet Calls on ESPN to Include Women in Discussion About Domestic Violence Statement from Nita Chaudhary , co-founder of UltraViolet , on ESPN 's announcement that a 11 man panel will discuss domestic violence during their Monday Night Football pre-game roundtable : '' By having a roundtable on domestic violence and not including any women , much less survivors of domestic violence , the panel is the height of ignorance by ESPN . ESPN must be getting their PR advice from their buddies at the NFL . Both the NFL and ESPN seem to greatly misunderstand the problem they are trying to address and the millions of people 's lives it effects . '' While it 's good to see ESPN taking on the issue of domestic violence within the NFL tonight , we strongly believe that they should also include the voices of women and survivors of domestic violence at the table . With nearly 45 % of NFL fans and viewers being women , including women at the table not only would add to the discussion but would address the realities of their audience and the issue at hand . '' But tonight 's episode of Monday Night Countdown is just going to be a regular episode , and will not be featuring any special discussion about domestic violence . We reached out to ESPN PR , who told us that talk of the special panel was `` false info '' and that tonight will feature a `` regular episode of Countdown hosted by Suzy Kolber . '' There are certainly criticisms to be made of Monday Night Countdown fielding such a dude-heavy panel that is painfully ill-equipped to speak intelligently about any issue of substance , as has been proven in the past . Tonight , however , it 's highly unlikely that domestic violence will even come up . Update : And here is a statement from ESPN : Contrary to published reports in Esquire , there was no panel on domestic violence ever planned for tonight 's Monday Night Countdown . We will present our normal Monday Night Football pre-game show , with Suzy Kolber hosting and Lisa Salters reporting . ESPN is proud of the work it has done covering the issue of domestic violence , and is committed to continued coverage .

Citing an unnamed source , French website iGen reports Apple is looking to field the Apple Watch at a proposed retail cost of $ 500 for versions with stainless steel cases and between $ 4,000 and $ 5,000 for Apple Watch Edition models . This leaves the Apple Watch Sport version as Apple 's lowest-priced option , which the company said would come in at $ 350 . While the website has been accurate in predicting recent Apple product launches , the claims are unverifiable and should be taken with a grain of salt . Previous estimates from jewelers and industry analysts pegged high-end Apple Watch Edition models at $ 1,200 . Edition versions are crafted from 18-karat gold , feature sapphire crystal and come with a variety of luxurious strap options . Apple has not commented on whether the entire chassis is solid gold , or merely gold plated , but the company apparently developed a variant of the metal twice as strong as the standard . Additionally , the source claims Apple is still shooting for a launch on Valentine 's Day . Prior to the Apple Watch announcement , noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo accurately predicted that the device would come in two sizes and multiple models spread across a wide range of price points . At the time , he speculated the wearable could cost into the `` thousands of dollars . '' Apple announced its anticipated first foray into the wearables market in September , saying only that pricing would start at $ 350 .

{"claim": "Catholic Priest Dead For 48 Minutes , Is Miraculously Revived \u2013 His Revelations About God Are Even More Shocking", "evidence": "A Catholic priest from Massachusetts had been dead for 48 minutes before he was miraculously resuscitated . However , it is his description about God that is bound to spark a hot debate about the almighty . Father John Michael O \u2019 Neal was officially declared dead for more than 48 minutes , but medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart . According to the 71-year-old man of God , the supreme entity isn \u2019 t a man , as is popularly assumed and believed . Father O \u2019 Neal claims he met God during the brief time he was officially dead and God is a woman . The catholic father claims God is a warm and comforting motherly figure . The revelation will undoubtedly have a profound bearing on the teachings of Christianity , which firmly believes and even implies that God is a male figure who has watched over us with love and devotion . Though the love and devotion part is corroborated by Father O \u2019 Neal , he differs from the church \u2019 s teachings about the gender of God . Father John Micheal O \u2019 neal had the chance to meet with the divine when he was rushed to a hospital late last month owing to a massive heart attack . However , Father O \u2019 Neal was declared clinically dead shortly after his arrival . Not one to give up hope so easily , doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital kept the blood flowing to his brain with the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2 . While the blood flowed with the help of modern science , doctors worked tirelessly to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm . Consistent with near-death experiences , Father O \u2019 Neal entered heaven through a gate made of bright light and encountered God . However , instead of the all-mighty father figure , the priest claims he was warmly greeted by a motherly figure . Father O \u2019 Neal describes the divine entity as \u201c mother-like \u2018 Being of Light . ' \u201d \u201c Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting . She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother \u2019 s embrace . The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn \u2019 t disturb me , she is everything I hoped she would be and even more ! \u201d As expected , the priest \u2019 s claims about the gender of God has created quite a stir amidst devote Catholics . The intense discussion between the catholic clergy of the archdiocese about the \u201c experience \u201d of the father and the ramifications of his revelations persuaded the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors . Though his superiors have disapproved , Father O \u2019 Neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the \u201c Holy Mother. \u201d \u201c I wish to continue preaching . I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother , the Son and the Holy Ghost with all Catholics and even all Christians . God is great and almighty despite being a woman\u2026 \u201d Given the potency of Father O \u2019 Neal \u2019 s alleged experience , it is quite likely he might face some resistance and criticism .

{"claim": "A message from Jim 's mom , Diane Foley :", "evidence": "In a new video , ISIS shows American-made weapons it says were intended for the Kurds but actually were air dropped into territory they control . At least one bundle of U.S. weapons airdropped in Syria appears to have fallen into the hands of ISIS , a dangerous misfire in the American mission to speed aid to Kurdish forces making their stand in Kobani . An ISIS-associated YouTube account posted a new video online Tuesday entitled , \u201c Weapons and munitions dropped by American planes and landed in the areas controlled by the Islamic State in Kobani. \u201d The video was also posted on the Twitter account of \u201c a3maq news , \u201d which acts as an unofficial media arm of ISIS . The outfit has previously posted videos of ISIS fighters firing American made Howitzer cannons and seizing marijuana fields in Syria . ISIS had broadly advertised its acquisition of a broad range of U.S.-made weapons during its rampage across Iraq . ISIS videos have showed its fighters driving U.S. tanks , MRAPs , Humvees . There are unconfirmed reports ISIS has stolen three fighter planes from Iraqi bases it conquered . The authenticity of this latest video could not be independently confirmed , but the ISIS fighters in the video are in possession of a rich bounty of American hand grenades , rounds for small rockets , and other supplies that they will surely turn around and use on the Kurdish forces they are fighting in and around the Turkish border city . On Monday , White House Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes said the U.S. government was confident that the emergency airdropped supplies for the Kurdish forces near Kobani were falling into the right hands . \u201c We feel very confident that , when we air drop support as we did into Kobani\u2026 we \u2019 ve been able to hit the target in terms of reaching the people we want to reach , \u201d Rhodes told CNN . \u201c What I can assure people is that , when we are delivering aid now , we focus it on the people we want to receive that assistance . Those are civilians in need . Those are forces that we \u2019 re aligned with in the fight against ISIL [ the government \u2019 s preferred acronym for ISIS ] , and we take precautions to make sure that it \u2019 s not falling into the wrong hands. \u201d Rhodes was responding to questions about a Monday report in The Daily Beast that U.S. humanitarian aid was flowing into ISIS controlled areas near Kobani by truck . That aid was mostly food and medical supplies , not the kind of lethal weapons in the new ISIS video . Senior administration officials said Sunday that three American planes dropped a total of 27 bundles near Kobani and more U.S. air drops could come as part of the joint U.S.-Iraqi effort to aid Kurdish fighters in the Kobani area . The supplies were provided by Kurdish authorities , the official said . In the new footage , the weapons appear to be U.S. made . There have also been at least 135 air strikes against ISIS in the area , according to the State Department . The airstrikes and air drops appear to be having an impact . The Daily Beast \u2019 s Jamie Dettmer , reporting from the Syrian border , said the morale in Kobani has shifted in the last 24 hours . But ISIS continues to hold major swaths of territory in and around Kobani , despite widespread media reports to the contrary . And the civilians there are suffering , badly . \u201c I think what this represents is the President recognizes this is going to be a long-term campaign against ISIL ; and that we need to look for whatever opportunity we can find to degrade that enemy and to support those who are fighting against ISIL on the ground , \u201d a senior administration official told reporters .", "label": "unrelated"}

The Washington Post published a lengthy article naming the masked man known as Jihadi John , who spoke in the videos with a British accent . Emwazi , believed to be aged 27 , was known to MI5 as a `` person of interest '' in 2011 , according to the BBC . It reports that his name was not revealed at an earlier stage for `` operational reasons '' . One of Emwazi 's friends was quoted by The Post as saying : \u201c I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John . '' The Post claims that Emwazi is from an affluent family in west London and graduated from the University of Westminster with a degree in computer programming . It says he is believed to have travelled to Syria in 2012 and later joined Isis . An international manhunt led by the FBI was launched in August 2014 when he was thought to have appeared in video footage showing the beheading of American photojournalist James Foley . Asim Qureshi , research director at the rights group , CAGE , said there was an `` extremely strong resemblance '' , between the militant in the videos and Emwazi . Mr Qureshi says he was in contact with Emwazi before he left for Syria . Foley 's death was followed by the brutal killing of four more UK and US aid workers and journalists , all of whom were shown in footage next to a balaclava clad militant dressed in black , believed to be Jihadi John . He is thought to have been featured in videos threatening the lives of Japanese hostages Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto , who were later killed by the extremist group . The name 'Jihadi John ' came after it was reported that hostages referred to the militant as 'John ' during their time captive . Emwazi is reported to have started to become radicalised after a trip he planned to Tanzania . He and two friends were detained by police overnight after landing in Dar es Salaam and eventually deported . It is claimed that Emwazi told friends he was flown to Amsterdam where an officer from MI5 accused him of trying to reach Somalia , where the militant group al-Shabaab operates . Mr Qureshi says he met with Emwazi in the autumn after he returned from this trip to discuss what had taken place . \u201c Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment , that he had been very unfairly treated , \u201d Mr Qureshi told The Post . The Post reports that Emwazi then moved to Kuwait , his birthplace , and returned to London twice before being detained by counterterrorism officials in Britain , who took his fingerprints and searched his belongings . He was allegedly prevented from returning to Kuwait , telling Mr Qureshi in an email : \u201c I had a job waiting for me and marriage to get started , but now I feel like a prisoner , only not in a cage , in London . '' Mr Qureshi last spoke to Emwazi in 2012 when he contacted him for advice . He felt \u201c actions were taken to criminalize him and he had no way to do something against these actions '' , according to Mr Qureshi . One friend said he believed Emwazi had wanted to teach English in Saudi Arabia but had been unsuccessful shortly before he disappeared . \u201c He at some stage reached the point where he was really just trying to find another way to get out , '' the friend was quoted as saying . The Metropolitan Police said in a statement : `` We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation .

{"claim": "Axl Rose Dead ? Of Course Not \u2014 Tiresome Internet Death Hoax Plague Hits Guns N \u2019 Roses Frontman", "evidence": "Boston - So lately , tongues have been wagging due to a recent story of an elderly priest who died and had a conversation with God , and a female God at that . The story has been dancing around on Facebook , Twitter , and Reddit . It 's also sallied across the seas and made it into the African media and the Indian media . The story even made it 's way to that holy land of obnoxious religious redneckery known as Texas . The story goes something like this : An old fart , er , I mean Catholic priest , in Massachusetts was officially dead for over 48 minutes before medical staff `` miraculously '' re-started his heart , World News Daily Report says . All the while , Father John Micheal O'Neal says he went to heaven and met God , who was all motherly and feminine and just happened to be a woman . Father O'Neal , 71 , was rushed to the hospital in late January after being hit with a major heart attack , but was declared dead shortly after his arrival . He was brought back to life via some sort of newfangled mechanical gadgetry and doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital , used more newfangled mechanical gadgetry to unclog vital arteries to his brain . Soon they returned his heart to a normal rhythm . Father O'Neal woke up less than 48 hours later and recovered perfectly , World News Daily Report says . Well , of course . I mean , after all , if you 're going to have a story about some elderly dude talking to God , you ca n't really have him die , can you ? That would n't come out in the wash . There was much wringing of hands , and Catholic Blogger Bridget Mary Meehan wrote : '' The declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days , causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors . Despite the disapproval of his superiors , Father O'Neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the 'Holy Mother . ' '' Then she wonders : '' Why is Cardinal O'Malley and the Boston Archdiocese so upset ? You would think he 'd be inspired . Perhaps , he is afraid that if God is a woman , then , that could put a big crack in the church 's stained glass ceiling and open the door to women priests ! '' Sure , why not employ more delusional people ? They 're certainly entertaining . But why is the good Archbishop bothered ? Perhaps because Father John Micheal O'Neal does n't exist . You see , he 's really a nice old man on Shutterstock , who probably wishes he were somewhere else other than the hospital . Terrence Donilon , a spokesman for Archbishop Sean P. O'Malley says the story is a hoax . `` We do not have a priest of this name , '' he told Metro.co.uk . `` I believe this could be a hoax story . '' And despite whatever Meehan thinks , it 's never been verified that O'Malley ever issued a public disavowal of the priest 's alleged statements . It 's just not in the public records , About.com reports . Perhaps , as this story runs its course , the media will realize it was asleep when it should have been awake . You see , World News Daily , makes no bones about the fact that it 's a satire site . Here 's the site 's disclaimer : '' WNDR assumes however all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content . All characters appearing in the articles in this website \u2013 even those based on real people \u2013 are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons , living , dead , or undead is purely a miracle . '' When Meehan was apprised of the fact that the story was a hoax , she offered up this fantasyland reply : '' According to a recent media update , this story is false , but I believe if it has n't yet happened , it truly will ! Someone once said : 'All stories are true some actually happened . ' '' I 'm not making this up .

{"claim": "This Letter To Parents From A 1970s Lego Set Contains An Important Message For Gender Equality", "evidence": "ABUJA , Nigeria \u2014 The leader of Nigeria 's Islamist extremist group dashed hopes for the release of 200 kidnapped girls Saturday , denying reports of a truce with the government . In a new video message , Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau says the schoolgirls have converted to Islam and married off . `` The issue of the girls is long forgotten because I have long ago married them off , '' he says , laughing . The news goes counter to what the Nigerian government said nearly two weeks ago when it announced a cease-fire deal with the terrorist organization , raising hopes among the families of the kidnapped girls \u2014 who were taken from the northeastern Nigerian town of Chibok in April \u2014 that their daughters would soon be released . But as the weeks dragged on with no sign of the kidnapped girls , hopes began to fade . `` I was very excited when I heard the news \u2014 I will finally reunite with my daughter , '' said Hamidah Amira , 36 , whose 17-year-old daughter was kidnapped . But then desperation set in , especially as Boko Haram abducted dozens of young women and teenagers in northeast Nigeria and continued to launch attacks that forced hundreds to flee . Despite those incidents , the government insisted negotiations with the Islamists were ongoing in Chad , as some began to raise doubts a cease-fire was even agreed upon by the group . Martin Ewi , senior researcher at the Institute for Security Studies ' office in Pretoria , said he did n't think Boko Haram had agreed to a truce , citing the lack of public statements on the issue in the past two weeks . `` The government might be talking to one faction \u2026 and then you have the other factions which might not have bought into the idea of dialogue , '' he said . Human Rights Watch estimates Boko Haram , whose name loosely translates as `` Western education is forbidden , '' has abducted around 500 young women over the past five years . Although some girls managed to escape from the Islamists , the whereabouts and the fate of the rest of the young women are uncertain . A recent Human Rights Watch report , based on interviews with victims and witnesses of Boko Haram abductions , offers rare insight into a series of physical and sexual abuses the girls suffer in captivity , including rape , forced labor and beating . `` We found that the Nigerian government has never interviewed these girls , never really found out or learned what they 've gone through , never attempted to do any kind of investigations , '' said Rona Peligal , Human Rights Watch deputy director for the Africa Division . `` They were kind of left on their own . '' Chibok resident Solomon Ali is deeply critical of the government 's handling of the situation since the beginning . `` We were disappointed that the government has done nothing to ensure these girls are released , '' he said , adding officials have failed to keep the community informed . Outraged by the kidnappings and the atrocities committed by Boko Haram , the international community has urged the Nigerian government to step up its efforts to free the girls . Since April , a campaign under the motto `` Bring Back Our Girls '' went viral on social media . Peligal says Nigerian authorities should do a better job responding to the Boko Haram threat and ensuring protection around schools . `` The government needs to better anticipate and plan for those kinds of abductions because they 're continuing , '' she said . `` And the government should respond capably . '' Ewi worries the girls would not be freed unless the government yields to Boko Haram 's demands to release some of their militants . `` You ca n't pursue military operations and still be hoping to release the girls alive , '' he said . Analysts warn the situation is likely to get worse in the months ahead of the 2015 election . Earlier this week , President Goodluck Jonathan , who is under increasing scrutiny for his failure to locate the girls , confirmed he would be running for re-election . `` The Boko Haram issue has been indeed politicized , and I expect it would be further politicized as we get closer to the election , '' said Peligal . In the meantime , Amira \u2014 like other moms \u2014 waits , while making a personal appeal to Boko Haram to release her daughter and the other girls . `` They should sympathize with us , not with the government , '' Amira said .

It was said Kim Yo Jong had taken over while her brother underwent medical treatment , but So Se Pyong , the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea 's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva , told Reuters Kim was not in bad health . The ambassador sat down for an interview where he discussed a variety of matters , including North Korea 's nuclear program , possibly negotiations to free three detained Americans and , of course , Kim \u2019 s health . It has been rumored Kim , 31 , might have had ankle surgery , but So said that is incorrect .

Questions about Kim \u2019 s health rose after an article from the Diplomat , a magazine based in Tokyo , claimed his sister was making important government decisions while Kim was being treated at Bonghwa Clinic in North Korea 's capital Pyongyang . `` Some say Hwang Byong So , director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People 's Army , may have assumed new No . 2 status , but given what has been confirmed this time , we can say Hwang is just a shadow , and Kim Yo Jong is the second-in-command of North Korea , '' Kim Heung Gwang , the head of North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity , reportedly said . Even if So denies any health problems , Kim has not been seen by his people since Sept. 3 .

{"claim": "Ski Resort Opens With Snow Stored From Last Season", "evidence": "NORTH Korean leader Kim Jong Un is in firm control of his government but has hurt his leg , a source with access to North Korea \u2019 s leadership said yesterday , playing down speculation over the 31-year-old \u2019 s health and grip on power . North Korea \u2019 s state media , which usually chronicles Kim \u2019 s whereabouts in great detail , has not made any mention of his activities since he attended a concert with his wife on September 3 . The source said that Kim hurt his leg while inspecting military exercises . \u201c He ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part , too . They were crawling and running and rolling around , and he pulled a tendon , \u201d the source said on condition of anonymity . \u201c He injured his ankle and knee around late August or early September while drilling because he is overweight . He limped around in the beginning but the injury worsened. \u201d Kim , who has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011 , had been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in July , which would imply he may have aggravated an earlier injury . Kim needs about 100 days to recuperate , said the source . \u201c Kim Jong Un is in total control , \u201d added the source , who has close ties to Pyongyang . North Korean officials have denied that Kim \u2019 s public absence is health-related and a United States official following North Korea said this week there were no indications that he was seriously ill or in political trouble . It remains unclear why a leg injury would keep Kim out of the public eye for so long , although this is not the first time he has been missing from public view . In June 2012 , six months after coming to power , state media failed to report on or photograph him for 23 days . He re-surfaced the next month at a dolphinarium . Speculation that Kim \u2019 s unusually long absence from public view may be due to ill health was fuelled by a TV report late last month that said he was suffering from \u201c discomfort. \u201d Some Pyongyang watchers also suggest that Kim may have been sidelined in a power struggle , a scenario they say was reinforced by the unexpected visit last Saturday of a high-level delegation to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in Incheon , South Korea . The source with knowledge of Kim \u2019 s health said rumors of a coup were \u201c rubbish. \u201d Kim was absent from a September 25 meeting of the Supreme People \u2019 s Assembly , or parliament , the first he has not attended since coming to power three years ago . However , Kim \u2019 s name has not disappeared from state propaganda .

'There sounds like a pause in it ( the audio ) . And when you hear that pause it brings some concern , ' said retired Chief Deputy U.S. Marshall Matthew Fog after listening on CNN . 'It is very significant , because if you have a pause there it means somebody had time to think and then fire again . ' If the audio is genuine it calls into question the version of events that Officer Wilson and the Ferguson police force have claimed occurred on August 9 . The medical examiner of behalf of the Brown family released this autopsy drawing which revealed Brown had been shot six times including once in the head At least two autopsies performed on Michael Brown have concluded he died after being shot six times by Wilson after being pulled over by the officer , including a fatal 'kill shot ' to the top of his head . Numerous witnesses , including Brown 's friend Dorian Johnson , claim that Wilson opened fire after bungling the opening of his squad car door , causing the teen to run before turning back to face the officer with his hands raised saying 'do n't shoot ' . Johnson then alleged that Wilson continued to fire on the 18-year-old . Photographs surround the casket of Michael Brown before the start of his funeral at the Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church in St Louis on Monday . The unarmed teen was killed on August 9 Ferguson police and friends of Officer Wilson contend that Brown engaged in a scuffle with Wilson when the officer pulled him and Johnson over , tried to grab his weapon and then run towards him , leaving him no choice but to fire . Indeed in recent days reports had emerged stating that Wilson , 28 , was badly beaten and left with serious facial injuries following the fatal shooting in the St Louis suburb , including an eye socket fracture . But CNN reported last Thursday that although the officer was taken to a hospital with a badly swollen face following the shooting on August 9 , x-rays came back negative for any serious injury . Earlier reports had claimed that the officer was almost knocked unconscious by Brown 's blows , according to the source . Last week , Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Wilson had suffered swelling to the side of his face but gave few details of the injuries . Wilson , a six-year veteran of the Ferguson force with a clean record , has not been arrested or charged with any crime . He is on paid leave pending the outcome of the investigation and is under 24-hour guard after death threats were aimed at him . Wilson is 'traumatized , scared for his life and his family ' along with being deeply concerned that a grand jury , which met for the first time on Wednesday , will make an example out of him , the source told Fox .

{"claim": "ISIL militant 'Jihadi John ' named by media", "evidence": "British man suspected of appearing in videos of hostages being beheaded The British Isis militant suspected of appearing in videos showing the beheading of US and UK hostages has been named in reports as Mohammed Emwazi from London . The Washington Post published a lengthy article naming the masked man known as Jihadi John , who spoke in the videos with a British accent . Emwazi , believed to be aged 27 , was known to MI5 as a `` person of interest '' in 2011 , according to the BBC . It reports that his name was not revealed at an earlier stage for `` operational reasons '' . One of Emwazi 's friends was quoted by The Post as saying : \u201c I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John . '' The Post claims that Emwazi is from an affluent family in west London and graduated from the University of Westminster with a degree in computer programming . It says he is believed to have travelled to Syria in 2012 and later joined Isis . An international manhunt led by the FBI was launched in August 2014 when he was thought to have appeared in video footage showing the beheading of American photojournalist James Foley . Asim Qureshi , research director at the rights group , CAGE , said there was an `` extremely strong resemblance '' , between the militant in the videos and Emwazi . Mr Qureshi says he was in contact with Emwazi before he left for Syria . Foley 's death was followed by the brutal killing of four more UK and US aid workers and journalists , all of whom were shown in footage next to a balaclava clad militant dressed in black , believed to be Jihadi John . He is thought to have been featured in videos threatening the lives of Japanese hostages Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto , who were later killed by the extremist group . The name 'Jihadi John ' came after it was reported that hostages referred to the militant as 'John ' during their time captive . Emwazi is reported to have started to become radicalised after a trip he planned to Tanzania . He and two friends were detained by police overnight after landing in Dar es Salaam and eventually deported . It is claimed that Emwazi told friends he was flown to Amsterdam where an officer from MI5 accused him of trying to reach Somalia , where the militant group al-Shabaab operates . Mr Qureshi says he met with Emwazi in the autumn after he returned from this trip to discuss what had taken place . \u201c Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment , that he had been very unfairly treated , \u201d Mr Qureshi told The Post . The Post reports that Emwazi then moved to Kuwait , his birthplace , and returned to London twice before being detained by counterterrorism officials in Britain , who took his fingerprints and searched his belongings . He was allegedly prevented from returning to Kuwait , telling Mr Qureshi in an email : \u201c I had a job waiting for me and marriage to get started , but now I feel like a prisoner , only not in a cage , in London . '' Mr Qureshi last spoke to Emwazi in 2012 when he contacted him for advice . He felt \u201c actions were taken to criminalize him and he had no way to do something against these actions '' , according to Mr Qureshi . One friend said he believed Emwazi had wanted to teach English in Saudi Arabia but had been unsuccessful shortly before he disappeared . \u201c He at some stage reached the point where he was really just trying to find another way to get out , '' the friend was quoted as saying . The Metropolitan Police said in a statement : `` We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation .

The 32-year-old actor is reportedly talks to portray Steve Wozniak - who created the Apple I computer and co-created the Apple II computer in the 1970s - according to The Wrap . Hollywood actress Jessica Chastain - who is currently starring alongside Matthew McConaughey in Christopher Nolan 's Interstellar - is also being courted for a role in the film , simply entitled Jobs . Scroll down for video Return of the Mac : Seth Rogen , left , is reportedly in talks to play Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak , right , in the upcoming Steve Jobs biography , Jobs Slumdog Millionaire film-maker Danny Boyle is to direct from a script by Aaron Sorkin , who used Steve Jobs ' authorised biography by Walter Isaacson . The film - which will reportedly not be a traditional biopic - is expected to follow the late technology whiz during three stressful and high profile product launches throughout Apple 's history . While talking with Bloomberg on Thursday , 53-year-old Aaron Sorkin revealed that British actor Christian Bale would be playing the title role in Jobs . A new Jobs : Christian Bale has been cast as the lead in Aaron Sorkin 's upcoming Steve Jobs biopic Based on the Steve Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson , Jobs will feature Bale , 40 , in every frame of the film . But that daunting acting task doesn \u2019 t worry Sorkin , who cast Bale without even an audition and called the Dark Knight trilogy star a \u2018 phenomenal actor \u2019 during the interview . If this all seems familiar , that is because another biographical film \u2013 with the same name \u2013 about Steve Jobs came out in August 2013 to a great deal of fanfare . Another Steve : Ashton Kutcher played Apple co-founder Steve Jobs in the 2013 film co-starring Josh Gad Starring Ashton Kutcher , 36 , as Jobs , that movie chronicled the Apple co-founder \u2019 s career from college in the 1970s through the introduction of the iPod in 2001 . Christian \u2019 s version , in contrast , will focus mostly on three major speeches Steve Jobs gave during his career . \u2018 What we needed was the best actor , \u2019 Sorkin said of Bale , who won an Oscar for his supporting role in 2010 \u2019 s The Fighter ( filmed between instalments of Bale \u2019 s Batman movies ) . Winner : Despite years of critically acclaimed roles , Bale won his first Academy Award for The Fighter in 2011 Christian was again nominated for an Oscar for 2013 \u2019 s American Hustle and has been a critically acclaimed actor since starring in Steven Spielberg \u2019 s Empire Of The Sun at 14 . Despite being best known as a superhero , Bale is known for physically transforming himself thoroughly between roles and thus should be fine to take on the more cerebral Jobs role . Before his death in 2011 from pancreatic cancer , Jobs gained a reputation as an excellent speaker , in addition to his work in creating and then transforming Apple Computers . It \u2019 s a big leap from Batman to Jobs , but if there \u2019 s one actor who can play both muscle-bound Bruce Wayne and skinny Steve Jobs , it is Christian Bale .

{"claim": "Officials shoot down congressman 's claims ISIS terrorists are running across US-Mexico border", "evidence": "KFC : Marijuana on the menu ? Not likely . A story that began circulating on Tuesday afternoon created a bit of a frenzy , but the fact is , there \u2019 s no sign KFC will really be selling marijuana in its stores . The story began at the Racket Report , where it was announced that marijuana profits were hitting such high levels that the fast food restaurant chain had decided to get in on the game . While the idea may appeal to pot lovers who think they can get the munchies and a bucket full of munchables in a single stop , there are a few problems . First and foremost , Racket Report appears to be a mostly satirical website , carrying multiple stories , such as the Fetal Ink Syndrome story , that have been debunked by fact-checking site Snopes . ( Here \u2018 s Snopes debunking the Fetal Ink Syndrome tale . ) KFC also doesn \u2019 t mention any marijuana sales on its official news page \u2014 a thing you \u2019 d think they \u2019 d mention if they were hoping to drum up sales . Another concern is banking . While marijuana shops were assured early in 2014 that they could have access to banks , many report still having difficulties . Though the original story claims that KFC \u2019 s pot sales will be cash only , in order to protect the restaurant \u2019 s funds , this would be no protection . If marijuana sales are understood to be federally illegal ( a question that is in limbo at the moment , with government officials calling on law enforcement to make pot arrests a very low priority , but laws still on the books ) then no funds collected by a facility could reasonably be protected . That is , if the government elected to seize funds illegally procured , they could still freeze bank accounts and seize the contents \u2014 even if all illegal dealings were handled in cash . This could not only be a concern for KFC , but for its parent company , YUM Brands . Notably , a KFC turned into a marijuana dispensary is a plot point in a South park episode , and there is another KFC that does indeed sell marijuana \u2014 but it \u2019 s not the fried chicken chain .

Nikolai Kryaglyachenko , 12 , was blasted across the pavement when he leant briefly against a lamppost that was live from a faulty wire . `` When I came round I felt groggy but managed to get home and told my mum what had happened , '' he said . `` When I woke up the next day and got out of bed I found some coins that had been lying on the mattress had stuck to my body . `` Then when I was having breakfast and dropped my spoon , it stuck to my chest . '' Europics 'Superpowers ' : Nikolai Kryaglyachenko wants to be a superhero when he grows up Nikolai said he was a keen fan of comics and , believing that maybe he had developed some sort of super magnetic power to attract metal like Magneto , had decided to put it to the test . `` I can do things I could n't do before but I do n't have a lot of control over it , '' he said . `` Even when I do not want to do it , I still attract things . `` Once I even attracted a glass - it just moved towards me . '' Nikolai added that he has now decided instead of a fireman he wants to be a superhero when he is older , saying that he would want to do something that helped people , and the job would certainly fulfil that role .

According to his classmates , he can influence others so that other people turn into live magnets as well . Nikolai 's classmate , Vika Balandina , said : `` I could even hang a ladle on my nose . '' Stories about `` living magnets '' began to appear at least in the middle of the 19th century . In 2004 , the story of a Russian factory worker Leonid Tenkaev and his family received extensive media coverage when he appeared to obtain the ability to attract objects after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster . Europics Cutlery collection : Nikolai Kryaglyachenko is a magnet for spoons and coins Although people who have the ability to attract metal items are commonly referred to as `` magnets , '' many of them can also hold plastic , glass , wood and paper items on their body . Only some of them develop a `` preference '' for a particular material . In 1990 , as many as 300 `` living magnets '' gathered for a conference in Sofia , the capital of Bulgaria , after young woman Marinela Brankova demonstrated her amazing ability on TV . The woman could hold 7 kilos of metal on a vertical palm . Scientists say however that rather than people being magnetic , it is probably nothing more than unusually sticky skin .

The e-commerce giant will roll out a new ad-supported streaming offering early next year that will be separate from its $ 99-a-year Prime membership , which includes a video service , sources said . The ad-supported option \u2014 part of an overhaul of its media offerings \u2014 poses a serious challenge to streaming rivals such as Hulu and Netflix , analysts said . \u201c If they do an ad-supported service , they will decouple it from Prime and that is a Netflix killer , \u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said . \u201c It won \u2019 t be $ 99 a year. \u201d Pachter suggested Amazon would undercut Netflix \u2019 s current monthly price of $ 7.99 . \u201c Who wouldn \u2019 t switch if you were poor or you \u2019 re a cord-cutter ? \u201d he added . Although it will be separate from Prime , the ad-supported service is ultimately a bid by Amazon to lure people to eventually pay up for Prime membership , said one ad source familiar with Amazon \u2019 s plans . \u201c The main point is to bring in more users that you can eventually up-sell to Prime , or to get to a broader audience that doesn \u2019 t want to pay for Prime , in order to increase their video share , \u201d the source said . The Wall Street Journal reported in March that Amazon was weighing such a move , but sources confirmed that it \u2019 s a definite go . Amazon is prepping a new attack at a time when its video service is gaining ground , sources said . Amazon doesn \u2019 t disclose the number of Prime members , but RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney estimates it has 50 million global customers . While Prime \u2019 s big draw has been two-day shipping , about half of Prime subscribers use the video service that is included with it , or around 25 million , sources said . By comparison , Netflix has 33 million domestic subscribers . A recent Sandvine study also shows that Amazon is making major strides \u2014 but has a long way to go before catching Netflix . Amazon \u2019 s broadband traffic on fixed networks grew from 1.61 percent to 2.58 percent , the study showed . One change is that Amazon snagged popular HBO content , including \u201c The Wire , \u201d \u201c True Blood \u201d and \u201c Boardwalk Empire. \u201d Netflix accounts for 32.39 percent of aggregate traffic . Rumors have been rampant that Amazon plans to let advertisers into its media ecosystem . Amazon has already experimented with ads in some shows , according to tech site Re/code . For advertisers , the service could be the Holy Grail in terms of targeting . In theory , Amazon could tell if ads viewed online led to purchases on its retail site . The news that Nielsen will start rating shows on subscription video services starting with Netflix is likely to encourage advertisers who want to make the leap without forcing Amazon to give up its own data . Amazon will also have leverage over content producers when it comes to the way it chooses to promote shows and movies within its growing ecosystem , a Hollywood source said .

{"claim": "Questions raised over Nicaragua 'meteorite '", "evidence": "Experts have raised doubts about whether a loud boom and a gaping crater found in Nicaragua 's crowded capital Managua this weekend were caused by a meteorite , as the government has said . The impact near the international airport did not cause any known injuries , but it did leave a crater measuring 12 metres across and was felt throughout the capital . The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration on Monday said that while a meteorite could not be ruled out , the lack so far of any eyewitness accounts of a fireball lighting up the nighttime sky outside Managua on Saturday suggests something else was likely behind the event . Bill Cooke , head of NASA 's Meteoroid Environment Office , estimated that the crater would have been created by a blast of roughly an energy equivalent of 1 ton of TNT . NASA said in a statement that a meteor capable of that would have created a ball of flame visible over a wide area . About 1.5 million people live in the Nicaraguan capital . `` For something to produce a hole in the ground that big , it would have generated a very bright fireball . And nothing was reported ... despite the population , '' Cooke said . `` So I 'm very sceptical . '' Nicaraguan authorities believe it was a piece of the small asteroid dubbed `` 2014 RC , '' which passed very close to Earth and was estimated by astronomers to be about 20 meters big , or the size of a house . 'Fascinating event' Government officials and experts visited the impact site on Sunday . One of them , William Martinez , said it was not yet clear if the meteorite burned up completely or if it had been blasted into the soil . `` You can see mirror-like spots on the sides of the crater from where the meteorite power-scraped the walls , '' Martinez said . Government spokeswoman , First Lady Rosario Murillo , said Nicaraguan authorities would be in contact with the US Geological Service to try to get more information about `` this fascinating event '' in the Central American nation , one of Latin America 's poorest countries . People who live near the crater told local media they heard a blast they took for an explosion , and that liquid , sand and dust were blown through the air , which smelled like something had burned .

Four Americans were killed in the attack , including U.S . Ambassador Christopher Stevens . Ansar al-Shariah , the group Washington holds responsible for the attack , have also seized parts of the Libyan capital and are known to work with terrorists from ISIS .

Tripoli is witnessing one of its worst spasms of violence since Gaddaffi left power . The militias , many of which originate from rebel forces that fought Gaddaffi , became powerful players in post-war Libya , filling a void left by weak police and a shattered army . Successive governments have put militias on their payroll in return for maintaining order , but rivalries over control and resources have led to fierce fighting among them and posed a constant challenge to the central government and a hoped-for transition to democracy . On Sunday , the Libyan government announced that they had lost control of the capital .

Mekkaoui said there is 'credible intelligence ' that the Masked Men Brigade 'is plotting to use the planes in attacks on the Maghreb state ' on the 9/11 anniversary . Sebastian Gorka , a counterterrorism expert , told the Free-Beacon that the planes could be used in two ways to strike North Africa or even as far as the oil fields of Saudi Arabia .

{"claim": "Boko Haram denies truce to release kidnapped schoolgirls", "evidence": "( CNN ) -- Despite government claims of a ceasefire , gunmen believed to be Boko Haram fighters attacked two villages and a town near the border with Niger , killing at least 8 and kidnapping others , residents told CNN Saturday . Boko Haram has not yet responded to the government 's announcement Thursday of a ceasefire , which an official said heralded peace in the country after some five years of conflict with the Islamic extremist group . In one attack , militants ambushed travelers in the Borno state village of Shaffa , residents of the area said , killing eight people and abducting others . Boko Haram gunmen also stormed the village of Waga in Adamawa state , abducting a number of residents , including women , residents there told CNN . Insurgents also occupied the town of Abadam , near Niger , after killing an unknown number of residents in their attack , residents said . Nigerian officials said Friday that the government had reached a ceasefire agreement with Boko Haram , which has been waging an insurgency in the country 's north since 2009 . The deal , the government said , includes the release of more than 200 kidnapped girls whose abduction from their boarding school shocked the world in April . The deal , first reported by Agence France-Presse , came Thursday night after a month of negotiations with representatives of the group , said Hassan Tukur , principal secretary to President Goodluck Jonathan . Nigerian officials met with Boko Haram in Chad twice during talks mediated by Chadian President Idriss Deby , according to Tukur . `` We have agreed on the release of the Chibok schoolgirls , and we expect to conclude on that at our next meeting with the group 's representative next week in Chad , '' Tukur said . Doyin Okupe , a government spokesman , said the ceasefire deal was meant not only to free the girls but also to end the insurgency . `` On the war front , we can say there is peace now , '' he said Friday . What is Boko Haram ? A source involved in talks with the militants told CNN last month that Nigerian government officials and the International Committee of the Red Cross had discussions with Boko Haram about swapping imprisoned members of the group for the more than 200 schoolgirls . It is unclear , however , whether the deal includes a prisoner swap . The name `` Boko Haram '' translates to `` Western education is sin '' in the local Hausa language . The militant group is trying to impose strict Sharia law across Nigeria , which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south . As part of its insurgency , the militant group has bombed schools , churches and mosques ; kidnapped women and children ; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike .
