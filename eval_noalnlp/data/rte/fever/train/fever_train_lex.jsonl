The latter half of their career saw a series of record-breaking tours that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery . The headline act was the English rock band , Led Zeppelin , who performed their first full-length concert since the death of drummer John Bonham in 1980 , in a one-off reunion . Rolling Stone magazine described them as `` the heaviest band of all time '' , `` the biggest band of the Seventies '' , and `` unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history '' . The group consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page , singer Robert Plant , bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones , and drummer John Bonham . After changing their name from the New Yardbirds , Led Zeppelin signed a deal with Atlantic Records that afforded them considerable artistic freedom . Although they remained commercially and critically successful , their output and touring schedule were limited during the late 1970s , and the group disbanded following Bonham 's death from alcohol-related asphyxia in 1980 . Led Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in London in 1968 . `` Stairway to Heaven '' is a song by the English rock band Led Zeppelin , released in late 1971 .
