# Fact Verification using Mean Teacher in PyTorch

In this fork of the original mean teacher code, we replace the feed forward networks in a mean teacher setup with 
 a decomposable attention. Also the data input is that from FEVER 2018 shared task.
 
# Pre reqs:
 
 The code runs on Python 3. Install the dependencies and prepare the datasets with the following commands:

```
conda create --name mean_teacher python=3 numpy scipy pandas nltk tqdm
source activate mean_teacher
pip sklearn
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/pytorch/vision@c31c3d7e0e68e871d2128c8b731698ed3b11b119
conda install pytorch-cpu torchvision-cpu -c pytorch *
```
\* **note**: for pytorch instinstallation get the right command from the pytorch [homepage](https://pytorch.org/) based on your OS and configs.

*PS: I personally like/trust `pip install *` instead of `conda install` * because the repos of pip are more comprehensive


The code expects to find the data in specific directories inside the data-local directory. So do remember to 
 add the data before you run the code.
 
 For example the data for RTE-FEVER is kept here:

```
/data-local/rte/fever/train/train_full_with_evi_sents.jsonl
```
Note that in this particular case the file train_full_with_evi_sents is a collection of all claims and the corresponding
 evidences in the training data of [FEVER](http://fever.ai/) challenge. This is not available in public unlike the FEVER data. 
 This is the output of the IR module of FEVER baseline [code](http://fever.ai/task.html).

To train on FEVER, run e.g.:


``` python main.py --run_on_server True
```

Latest status as of Nov 11th 2019.

Ran using python main.py command above. Runs lex and delex training 3724 batches (119197/32) However only till epoch 0. Also val accuracy is negative. that is a
big problem.
