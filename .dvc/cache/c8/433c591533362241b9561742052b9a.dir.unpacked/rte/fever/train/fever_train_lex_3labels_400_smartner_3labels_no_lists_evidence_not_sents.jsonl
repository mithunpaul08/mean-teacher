{"claim": "Led Zeppelin is a band .", "evidence": "The band 's heavy , guitar-driven sound , rooted in blues and psychedelia on their early albums , has earned them recognition as one of the progenitors of heavy metal , though their unique style drew from a wide variety of influences , including folk music . The latter half of their career saw a series of record-breaking tours that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery . The headline act was the English rock band , Led Zeppelin , who performed their first full-length concert since the death of drummer John Bonham in 1980 , in a one-off reunion . Rolling Stone magazine described them as `` the heaviest band of all time '' , `` the biggest band of the Seventies '' , and `` unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history '' . The group consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page , singer Robert Plant , bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones , and drummer John Bonham . After changing their name from the New Yardbirds , Led Zeppelin signed a deal with Atlantic Records that afforded them considerable artistic freedom . Although they remained commercially and critically successful , their output and touring schedule were limited during the late 1970s , and the group disbanded following Bonham 's death from alcohol-related asphyxia in 1980 . Led Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in London in 1968 . `` Stairway to Heaven '' is a song by the English rock band Led Zeppelin , released in late 1971 . The most successful of these was the 2007 Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in London , with Jason Bonham taking his late father 's place behind the drums .
