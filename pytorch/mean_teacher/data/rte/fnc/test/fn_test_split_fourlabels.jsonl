Following rumors over the weekend , HP is announcing today that it will separate its PC and printer division from its enterprise and services business . The split means current CEO Meg Whitman will become the chairman of the PC and printer operation , and continue as CEO of the split-off enterprise business . Dion Weisler , an executive at HP 's PC business , will take over as CEO of the company 's PC and printer operation . HP Enterprise is the newly split-off part of the original company , and HP Inc will continue to focus on PCs and printers . `` The decision to separate into two market-leading companies underscores our commitment to the turnaround plan , '' says HP CEO Meg Whitman . `` It will provide each new company with the independence , focus , financial resources , and flexibility they need to adapt quickly to market and customer dynamics , while generating long-term value for shareholders . '' HP is planning to complete the split by the end of fiscal 2015 , and the structure will mean the company 's total planned layoffs will rise to 55,000 from an earlier estimate of 45,000 to 50,000 cuts . Today 's split is a significant change for the company , following rumors from 2011 that HP was considering a similar split at the time . Those reports surfaced shortly before HP appointed Meg Witman as CEO , just 11 months after former CEO Leo Apotheker took over from Mark Hurd after he was forced to resign amidst charges of inappropriate business conduct . Apotheker spearheaded a disastrous acquisition of Autonomy , and failed to capitalize on the company 's purchase of webOS . Whitman 's era at HP has seen the company struggle to cement a solid position in the industry , leaving Lenovo to dominate PC sales worldwide . Whitman 's initial assessment of the company after around six months left her feeling it was `` too complex and too slow , '' noting it had underinvested in its PC division . Instead of significant investment , Whitman claimed in 2012 that the company had to offer a smartphone , before failing to announce one in 2013 . Board members reportedly mulled spinning off the company 's consumer PC business in 2013 , but it never happened . HP has recently focused on Android tablets , and even an Android laptop , after describing Microsoft as an `` outright competitor . '' HP and Microsoft appear to be forming a closer relationship with the launch of new low-cost Stream PCs . Although Lenovo continues to push Windows-based PCs , Microsoft still needs close PC allies as it demonstrated with a $ 2 billion loan to help Dell go private last year . That particular deal may have angered HP , but the renewed partnership will see Microsoft and HP take on Chromebooks this holiday season . HP is also planning to sell a smartwatch this fall . A new HP says it will focus on `` new computing experiences '' and technologies like 3D printing . `` As the market leader in printing and personal systems , an independent HP Inc. will be extremely well positioned to deliver that innovation across our traditional markets as well as extend our leadership into new markets like 3-D printing and new computing experiences -- inventing technology that empowers people to create , interact and inspire like never before , '' says Dion Weisler , head of HP 's Printing and Personal Systems business .

Though only part of the story is true , we 're sort of thrilled to be able to report that it 's the part about the mid-brain surgery conversation about cats . Iga revealed on her Facebook page Saturday that her temporary consciousness during the procedure was actually all part of the plan . The teen told well wishers that when it came to the publications sharing her story , many articles have a lot of mistakes. She explains that far from being a shock to her doctors , waking me up was deliberate \u2013 This method is called Awake Craniatomy . It was deliberate and planned. Jasica even provided readers with a link to the website of University Hospital Southampton where the surgery is described in detail . An awake craniotomy is an operation performed in the same manner as a conventional craniotomy but with the patient awake during the procedure . This is a preferred technique for operations to remove lesions close to , or involving , eloquent ( functionally important ) regions of the brain . This allows us to test regions of the brain before they are incised or removed and allows us to test patient 's function continuously throughout the operation . The overall aim is to minimise the risks of such operations , it says . Despite the fact that her brain was indeed exposed during the waking parts of her surgery , neurosurgeon Dawid Larysz recently assured The Daily Mirror that Jasica would not have been able to see or hear anything . Despite coming round , she didn 't feel anything and was never in danger , he said . Recommended for You Webcast : The Art of Growth Hacking : Gaining Early Traction by Doing Things that Do n't Scale Jasica herself later commented , I can 't remember much , but the doctor said he talked to me about cats , which I love . I missed Christmas because of this operation , but it is the best present I could have had , as I am now feeling great. She stresses on her Facebook page that the operation was successful and there was nothing damaged. The teen says it 's important to her that people know that the Doctors saved my life and encourages readers to not be influenced by stupid articles. Otherwise the 19-year-old seems to be progressing well in her recovery and is looking forward to healthier days .

'They were actually an impedance , ' Foley told Fox News , referring to the government 's role in rescuing his older brother , a photojournalist who was kidnapped by ISIS militants in Northern Syria in 2012 . 'They got in our way ... That 's what really bothers me to the core . ' The U.S. follows a strict policy of never negotiating with terrorist organizations or paying ransom for Americans kidnapped by them , arguing doing so only leads to more abductions . Scroll down for video James Foley 's parents John and Diane Foley and his brother , Michael , speak to reporters about James ' murder outside of their home in Rochester , New Hampshire , last month . Michael has become particularly outspoken about the failures of the Obama administration to rescue his brother and for threatening the family for trying to raise funds to secure his release Captured and executed : James Foley was taken hostage on Thanksgiving , 2012 , while working for GlobalPost in northern Syria and executed - video of the brutal act was released online on August 19 'We have found that terrorist organizations use hostage taking and ransoms as a critical source of financing for their organization and that paying ransoms only puts other Americans in a position where they 're at even greater risk , ' White House spokesman John Earnest said . Foley , however , said the government made it difficult for the family to privately raise funds to secure his brother 's freedom . 'I was specifically threatened by the Department of State about raising funds towards ransom demands for my brother , ' he said . 'We were smart enough to look past it but it slowed us down . We lost a lot of time . ' US freelance reporter James Foley was kidnapped in war-torn Syria in November , 2012 and executed by his ISIS captors in a video posted online on August 19 of this year Michael Foley , at right , and other members of his family tried desperately to raise funds to secure James ' release from the hands of his captors In a separate interview with ABC News , his mother , Diane Foley , said a military officer working for the National Security Council told them several times that her family could face criminal charges if they paid a ransom . 'We took it as a threat and it was appalling , ' she said . 'Three times he intimidated us with that message . We were horrified he would say that . He just told us we would be prosecuted . We knew we had to save our son , we had to try , ' A spokeswoman for the National Security Council said that the Foley family was informed of U.S. laws banning terrorism financing but denied members were told they could face charges if they made a ransom payment , according to ABC . Michael Foley also said in the interview the new military campaign the U.S. is pursuing to stop ISIS 'came too late for Jim . ' Devastated : Diane and John Foley talk to reporters , on Wednesday August 20 , 2014 outside their home in Rochester , New Hampshire . The day before shocking footage of their son 's execution was posted online Strategy : President Barack Obama addresses the nation from the Cross Hall in the White House in Washington on Wednesday and said he had authorized U.S. airstrikes inside Syria for the first time , along with expanded strikes in Iraq , as part of 'a steady , relentless effort ' to root out Islamic State extremists 'I just hope it 's not too late for others , ' he said . ISIS is still holding several hostages from Western and other countries . Diane Foley earlier spoke of her deep disappointment she felt towards the Obama administration for its handling of his time as a prisoner of the terror group , saying , 'I really feel our country let Jim down . ' On the 13th anniversary of 9/11 and the day after President Obama addressed the nation and finally offered a strategy to defeat ISIS , Foley told CNN that 'as an American ' , she was 'embarrassed and appalled ' at the efforts to rescue her son from captivity . Articulate and thoughtful throughout her interview , she made the startling claim that US officials threatened her family with prosecution if they tried to raise a ransom for Foley , 40 , and said 'Jim was sacrificed because of a lack of communication and prioritization . ' And in a thinly veiled attack on Obama 's new strategy to 'degrade and destroy ' ISIS she said that meeting violence with more violence may not be the answer and said , 'bombing caused Jim 's death . ' 'Jim was killed in the most horrific way . He was sacrificed because of just a lack of coordination , lack of communication , lack of prioritization , ' Foley said . 'As a family , we had to find our way through this on our own . ' Still grieving , Diane Foley also said US officials told her they would not exchange prisoners or carry out any military action to try and rescue her son . At times withering in her assessment of the Obama administration 's co-ordination with her family , Mrs. Foley poured scorn on the Pentagon 's claim they tried to rescue Foley on July 4 , only to raid the wrong base . Speaking to CNN 's Anderson Cooper , Foley said her family knew where James Foley was being held on two separate occasions in Syria , and that each time he was there for months following his capture on Thanksgiving , 2012 . On August 19 , ISIS released a gruesome video online which showed the beheading of Foley by a masked ISIS militant , who told the camera in a British accent , that his 'real killer ' was the United States . Exactly two weeks later , another American journalist , Stephen Sotloff , was beheaded , apparently by the same man , who tells the camera , 'I 'm back Obama ' . During the efforts to get James home , Mrs. Foley said she met good people , people who wanted to help , but was adamant that she did n't want to single anyone out and lay 'blame ' . Mrs. Foley said it was important to remember that ISIS is the enemy and not the United States . However , ultimately , she 'did n't feel that Jim was a priority .
